# Procurement LLM Project Plan

## Project Goal
Develop a specialized LLM system by fine-tuning IBM GRANITE 3.2 8B Instruct to analyze procurement documents (RFPs) and evaluate bids for connectivity services, creating both a trained model and an inference API that can extract key information from RFPs and provide objective, consistent bid evaluations.

## Implementation Approach for IBM GRANITE 3.2 8B Instruct

1. **Model Acquisition and Hosting Strategy**:
   - Download the IBM GRANITE 3.2 8B Instruct model from Hugging Face Hub
   - Since the model is not available via Inference API, we'll self-host using:
     - Docker container with optimized inference setup
     - Deploy to cloud provider with GPU support (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
     - Implement API gateway for secure access

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Convert procurement documents to text using document processor
   - Create instruction tuning format datasets with input-output pairs
   - Structure data for fine-tuning with procurement-specific prompts

3. **Model Fine-tuning**:
   - Use Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA
   - Train on Hugging Face's infrastructure to avoid local GPU requirements
   - Track experiments and model versions

4. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Use Docker to containerize the fine-tuned model
   - Deploy to cloud infrastructure with GPU support
   - Develop FastAPI wrapper for document handling and result formatting

5. **Evaluation Method**:
   - Compare extraction accuracy against human-annotated examples
   - Use domain experts to evaluate bid scoring accuracy
   - Implement weighted scoring system (60% RFP requirements, 40% best practices)

## Expected End Results

1. **Fine-tuned IBM GRANITE 3.2 8B Instruct Model**:
   - Specialized in procurement document analysis
   - Self-hosted for inference (since Hugging Face Inference API is disabled)

2. **Self-hosted Inference API**:
   - Accessible via RESTful endpoints
   - Accepts RFP documents and returns structured information
   - Processes bid documents and provides objective evaluations

3. **Functional Capabilities**:
   - Extract key requirements from RFPs with high accuracy
   - Identify evaluation criteria and weights
   - Extract technical specifications and compliance requirements
   - Score bids against RFP requirements
   - Provide justifications for scores
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses in proposals

4. **Documentation and Resources**:
   - API documentation for integration
   - Model card explaining capabilities and limitations
   - Example code for common use cases

This project will result in a specialized procurement AI system that can dramatically reduce the time and subjectivity involved in RFP analysis and bid evaluation, providing consistent and traceable procurement decisions.
