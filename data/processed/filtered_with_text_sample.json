Nonconformities, Errors, and Omissions\n\tProvided that a bid is substantially responsive, the Employer may waive any non-conformities in the bid.\n\n\t\n\tProvided that a bid is substantially responsive, the Employer may request that the Bidder submit the necessary information or documentation, within a reasonable period of time, to rectify nonmaterial nonconformities in the bid related to documentation requirements. Requesting information or documentation on such nonconformities shall not be related to any aspect of the price of the bid. Failure of the Bidder to comply with the request may result in the rejection of its bid.\n\n\t\n\tProvided that a bid is substantially responsive, the Employer shall rectify quantifiable nonmaterial nonconformities related to the Bid Price. To this effect, the Bid Price may be adjusted, for comparison purposes only, to reflect the price of a missing or non-conforming item or component. The adjustment shall be made using the methods indicated in Section III (Evaluation and Qualification Criteria).\n\n\t31. Correction of Arithmetical Errors\n\tProvided that the bid is substantially responsive, the Employer shall correct arithmetical errors on the following basis:\n\n(a)\nonly for unit price contracts, if there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total price that is obtained by multiplying the unit price and quantity, the unit price shall prevail and the total price shall be corrected, unless in the opinion of the Employer there is an obvious misplacement of the decimal point in the unit price, in which case the total price as quoted shall govern and the unit price shall be corrected;\n\n(b)\nif there is an error in a total corresponding to the addition or subtraction of subtotals, the subtotals shall prevail and the total shall be corrected; and\n\n(c)\nif there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words shall prevail, unless the amount expressed in words is related to an arithmetic error, in which case the amount in figures shall prevail subject to (a) and (b) above.\n\n\t\n\tIf the Bidder that submitted the best-evaluated bid does not accept the correction of errors, its bid shall be declared non-responsive.\n\n\t32. Conversion to Single Currency \n\tFor evaluation and comparison purposes, the currency(ies) of the bid shall be converted into a single currency as specified in the BDS.   \n\n\t33. Margin of Preference\n\t33.1 A margin of preference shall not apply, unless otherwise specified in the BDS.\nDomestic bidders shall provide all evidence necessary to prove that they meet the following criteria to be eligible for a 7\u00bd percent margin of preference in the comparison of their bids with those of bidders who do not qualify for the preference.  They should:\n\n(a)\nbe registered within the country of the Employer\u2019s country ;\n\n(b)\nhave majority ownership by nationals of the country of the Employer\u2019s country ;\n\n(c)\nnot subcontract more than 10 percent of the Contract Price, excluding provisional sums, to foreign contractors.\n\n33.3\nThe following procedure shall be used to apply the margin of preference:\n\n(a)\nResponsive bids shall be classified into the following groups:\n\n(i)\nGroup A:  bids offered by domestic bidders and joint ventures meeting the criteria of ITB Sub-Clause 33.2; and\n\n(ii)\nGroup B:  all other bids.\n\n(b)\nFor the purpose of further evaluation and comparison of bids only, an amount equal to 7\u00bd percent of the evaluated Bid prices determined in accordance with ITB Sub-Clause 33.2 shall be added to all bids classified in Group B.\n\n\t34. Evaluation of Bids\n\t34.1 The Employer shall use the criteria and methodologies listed in this Clause. No other evaluation criteria or methodologies shall be permitted.\n\n\t\n\t34.2 To evaluate a bid, the Employer shall consider the following:\n\n(a)\nthe bid price, excluding Provisional Sums and the provision, if any, for contingencies in the Summary Bill of Quantities for admeasurement contracts or Schedule of Prices for lump sum contracts, but including Daywork items, where priced competitively;\n\n(b)\nprice adjustment for correction of arithmetic errors in accordance with ITB 31.1;\n\n(c)\nprice adjustment due to discounts offered in accordance with ITB 14.3;\n\n(d)\nconverting the amount resulting from applying (a) to (c) above, if relevant, to a single currency in accordance with ITB 32;\n(e)\nadjustment for nonconformities in accordance with ITB 30.3;\n\n(f)\napplication of all the evaluation factors indicated in Section III (Evaluation and Qualification Criteria);\n\n\t\n\t34.3 The estimated effect of the price adjustment provisions of the Conditions of Contract, applied over the period of execution of the Contract, shall not be taken into account in bid evaluation.\n\n\t\n\t34.4 If this Bidding Document allows Bidders to quote separate prices for different contracts, and to award multiple contracts to a single Bidder, the methodology to determine the best-evaluated price of the contract combinations, including any discounts offered in the Letter of Bid, is specified in Section III (Evaluation and Qualification Criteria).\n\n\t\n\t34.5 If the bid for an admeasurement contract, which results in the best-evaluated Bid Price, is seriously unbalanced, front loaded or substantially below updated estimates in the opinion of the Employer, the Employer may require the Bidder to produce detailed price analyses for any or all items of the Bill of Quantities, to demonstrate the internal consistency of those prices with the construction methods and schedule proposed. After evaluation of the price analyses, taking into consideration the schedule of estimated Contract payments, the Employer may require that the amount of the performance security be increased at the expense of the Bidder to a level sufficient to protect the Employer against financial loss in the event of default of the successful Bidder under the Contract.\n\n\t35. Comparison of Bids\n\t35.1 The Employer shall compare all substantially responsive bids in accordance with ITB 34.2 to determine the best-evaluated bid.\n\n\t36. Qualification of the Bidder\n\t36.1 The Employer shall determine to its satisfaction whether the Bidder that is selected as having submitted the best-evaluated and substantially responsive bid meets the qualifying criteria specified in Section III (Evaluation and Qualification Criteria).\n\n\t\n\t36.2 The determination shall be based upon an examination of the documentary evidence of the Bidder\u2019s qualifications submitted by the Bidder, pursuant to ITB 17.1.\n\n\t\n\t36.3 An affirmative determination of qualification shall be a prerequisite for award of the Contract to the Bidder. A negative determination shall result in disqualification of the bid, in which event the Employer shall proceed to the next best-evaluated bid to make a similar determination of that Bidder\u2019s qualifications to perform satisfactorily.\n\n\t37. Employer\u2019s Right to Accept Any Bid, and to Reject Any or All Bids\n\t37.1 The Employer reserves the right to accept or reject any bid, and to annul the bidding process and reject all bids at any time prior to contract award, without thereby incurring any liability to Bidders. In case of annulment, all bids submitted and specifically, bid securities, shall be promptly returned to the Bidders.\n\n\tF. Award of Contract\n\n\t38. Award Criteria\n\t38.1 Subject to ITB 37.1, the Employer shall award the Contract to the Bidder whose offer has been determined to be the best-evaluated bid and is substantially responsive to the Bidding Document, provided further that the Bidder is determined to be qualified to perform the Contract satisfactorily.\n\n\t39. Notification of Award\n\t39.1 Prior to the expiration of the period of bid validity, the Employer shall notify the successful Bidder, in writing, via the Letter of Acceptance included in the Contract Forms, that its bid has been accepted.  At the same time, the Employer shall also notify all other Bidders of the results of the bidding, and shall publish in UNDB online and in the dg Market the results identifying the bid and lot numbers and the following information: (i) name of each Bidder who submitted a Bid; (ii) bid prices as read out at Bid Opening; (iii) name and evaluated prices of each Bid that was evaluated; (iv) name of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (v) name of the winning Bidder, and the Price it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract awarded.\n\n\t\n\t39.2 Until a formal contract is prepared and executed, the notification of award shall constitute a binding Contract.\n\n\t\n\tThe Employer shall promptly respond in writing to any unsuccessful Bidder who, after notification of award in accordance with ITB 39.1, requests in writing the grounds on which its bid was not selected.\n\n\t40. Signing of Contract\n\t40.1 Promptly upon notification, the Employer shall send the successful Bidder the Contract Agreement.\n\n\t\n\t40.2 Within twenty-eight (28) days of receipt of the Contract Agreement, the successful Bidder shall sign, date, and return it to the Employer.\n\n\t41. Performance Security\n\t41.1 Within twenty-eight (28) days of the receipt of notification of award from the Employer, the successful Bidder shall furnish the performance security in accordance with the conditions of contract, subject to ITB 34.5, using for that purpose the Performance Security Form included in Section IX (Contract Forms), or another form acceptable to the Employer.  If the performance security furnished by the successful Bidder is in the form of a bond, it shall be issued by a bonding or insurance company that has been determined by the successful Bidder to be acceptable to the Employer. A foreign institution providing a bond shall have a correspondent financial institution located in the Employer\u2019s Country.\n\n\t\n\t41.2 Failure of the successful Bidder to submit the above-mentioned Performance Security or to sign the Contract Agreement shall constitute sufficient grounds for the annulment of the award and forfeiture of the bid security. In that event the Employer may award the Contract to the next best-evaluated Bidder whose offer is substantially responsive and is determined by the Employer to be qualified to perform the Contract satisfactorily.\n\n\t\n\t41.3 The above provision shall also apply to the furnishing of a domestic preference security if so required.\n\n\t42. Adjudicator\n\t42.1 The Employer proposes the person named in the BDS to be appointed as Adjudicator under the Contract, at the hourly fee specified in the BDS, plus reimbursable expenses.  If the Bidder disagrees with this proposal, the Bidder should so state in his Bid.  If, in the Letter of Acceptance, the Employer does not agree on the appointment of the Adjudicator, the Employer will request the Appointing Authority designated in the Particular Conditions of Contract (PCC) pursuant to Clause 23.1 of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC), to appoint the Adjudicator.\n\n\nSection II - Bid Data Sheet (BDS)\n\nIntroduction\n\n\tITB Reference\n\tA.

Bank-Financed Procurement\n\n1. In accordance with Section 61 of the Public Procurement Act No. 12 of 2008 and Clause 155 of the Public Procurement Regulations of 2011, the Government permits firms and individuals from all countries to offer goods, works and services for Government-financed projects. As an exception, firms of a Country or goods manufactured in a Country may be excluded if:\n\n(i): as a matter of law or official regulation, Government prohibits commercial relations with that Country, provided that Cooperating Partners involved are satisfied that such exclusion does not preclude effective competition for the supply of the Goods or Works required, or \n\n(ii): by an Act of Compliance with a Decision of the United Nations Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, the Government prohibits any import of goods from that Country or any payments to persons or entities in that Country.\n\n2. For the information of bidders, at the present time firms, goods and services from the following countries are excluded from this bidding:\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\nPART 2 \u2013 Employer\u2019s Requirements\n\nSection VI - Employer\u2019s Requirements\nTable of Contents\n\n4Specifications\n2-\n\n6Drawings\n2-\n\n7Supplementary Information\n2-\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nA set of precise and clear Specifications is a prerequisite for bidders to respond realistically and competitively to the requirements of the Employer without qualifying or conditioning their bids.  In the context of international competitive bidding, the Specifications must be drafted to permit the widest possible competition and, at the same time, present a clear statement of the required standards of workmanship, materials, and performance of the goods and services to be procured.  Only if this is done shall the objectives of economy, efficiency, and fairness in procurement be realized, responsiveness of bids be ensured, and the subsequent task of Bid evaluation facilitated.  The Specifications should require that all goods and materials to be incorporated in the Works be new, unused, of the most recent or current models, and incorporate all recent improvements in design and materials unless provided otherwise in the Contract.\n\nSamples of Specifications from previous similar projects in the same country are useful in to prepare Specifications.  The use of metric units is encouraged by the Government.  Most Specifications are normally written specially by the Employer or Project Manager to suit the Contract Works in hand.  There is no standard set of Specifications for universal application in all sectors in all countries, but there are established principles and practices, which are reflected in these documents.\n\nThere are considerable advantages in standardizing General Specifications for repetitive Works in recognized public sectors, such as highways, ports, railways, urban housing, irrigation, and water supply, in the same country or region where similar conditions prevail. The General Specifications should cover all classes of workmanship, materials, and equipment commonly involved in construction, although not necessarily to be used in a particular Works Contract.  Deletions or addendums should then adapt the General Specifications to apply them to the particular Works.\n\nCare must be taken in drafting Specifications to ensure that they are not restrictive.  In the Specifications of standards for goods, materials, and workmanship, recognized international standards should be used as much as possible.  Where other particular standards are used, whether Zambian standards or other standards, the Specifications should state that goods, materials, and workmanship that meet other authoritative standards, and which ensure substantially equal or higher quality than the standards mentioned, shall also be acceptable. To that effect, the following sample clause may be inserted in the Special Conditions or Specifications.\n\n\u201cEquivalency of Standards and Codes\nWherever reference is made in the Contract to specific standards and codes to be met by the goods and materials to be furnished, and work performed or tested, the provisions of the latest current edition or revision of the relevant standards and codes in effect shall apply, unless otherwise expressly stated in the Contract.  Where such standards and codes are national, or relate to a particular country or region, other authoritative standards that ensure a substantially equal or higher quality than the standards and codes specified shall be accepted subject to the Project Manager\u2019s prior review and written consent.  Differences between the standards specified and the proposed alternative standards shall be fully described in writing by the Contractor and submitted to the Project Manager at least 28 days prior to the date when the Contractor desires the Project Manager\u2019s consent.  In the event the Project Manager determines that such proposed deviations do not ensure substantially equal or higher quality, the Contractor shall comply with the standards specified in the documents.\u201d\n\nThese Notes for Preparing Specifications are intended only as information for the Employer or the person drafting the bidding documents.  They should not be included in the final documents.\nBill of Quantity and Drawings\n\n\nThe bill of quantity and drawings are attached as annexes.\nSupplementary Information\n\nPART 3 \u2013 Conditions of Contract and Contract Forms\n\nSection VII.  General Conditions of Contract\n\nThese General Conditions of Contract (GCC), read in conjunction with the Particular Conditions of Contract (PCC) and other documents listed therein, should be a complete document expressing fairly the rights and obligations of both parties.\n\nThese General Conditions of Contract have been developed on the basis of considerable international experience in the drafting and management of contracts, bearing in mind a trend in the construction industry towards simpler, more straightforward language.\n\nThe GCC can be used for both smaller admeasurement contracts and lump sum contracts.\n\nTable of Clauses\n\n6A.

The Contractor\u2019s and its Subcontractors\u2019 and sub-consultants\u2019 attention is drawn to Sub-Clause 57.1 which provides, inter alia, that acts intended to materially impede the exercise of the Government\u2019s inspection and audit rights provided for under Sub-Clause 22.2 constitute a prohibited practice subject to contract termination (as well as to a determination of ineligibility pursuant to ZPPA\u2019s prevailing sanctions procedures).\n\n\t23. Appointment of the Adjudicator\n\t23.1 The Adjudicator shall be appointed jointly by the Employer and the Contractor, at the time of the Employer\u2019s issuance of the Letter of Acceptance.  If, in the Letter of Acceptance, the Employer does not agree on the appointment of the Adjudicator, the Employer will request the Appointing Authority designated in the PCC, to appoint the Adjudicator within 14 days of receipt of such request. \n\n23.2 Should the Adjudicator resign or die, or should the Employer and the Contractor agree that the Adjudicator is not functioning in accordance with the provisions of the Co\n23.3 Contract; a new Adjudicator shall be jointly appointed by the Employer and the Contractor.  In case of disagreement between the Employer and the Contractor, within 30 days, the Adjudicator shall be designated by the Appointing Authority designated in the PCC at the request of either party, within 14 days of receipt of such request.\n\n\t24. Procedure for Disputes\n\t24.1 If the Contractor believes that a decision taken by the Project Manager was either outside the authority given to the Project Manager by the Contract or that the decision was wrongly taken, the decision shall be referred to the Adjudicator within 14 days of the notification of the Project Manager\u2019s decision.\n\n24.2 The Adjudicator shall give a decision in writing within 28 days of receipt of a notification of a dispute.\n\n24.3 The Adjudicator shall be paid by the hour at the rate specified in the PCC, together with reimbursable expenses of the types specified in the PCC, and the cost shall be divided equally between the Employer and the Contractor, whatever decision is reached by the Adjudicator.  Either party may refer a decision of the Adjudicator to an Arbitrator within 28 days of the Adjudicator\u2019s written decision.  If neither party refers the dispute to arbitration within the above 28 days, the Adjudicator\u2019s decision shall be final and binding.\n\n24.4 The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the arbitration procedures published by the institution named and in the place specified in the PCC. \n\n\nB.  Time Control\n\n\t25. Program\n\n\n\t25.1 Within the time stated in the PCC, after the date of the Letter of Acceptance, the Contractor shall submit to the Project Manager for approval a Program showing the general methods, arrangements, order, and timing for all the activities in the Works. In the case of a lump sum contract, the activities in the Program shall be consistent with those in the Activity Schedule.\n\n25.2 An update of the Program shall be a program showing the actual progress achieved on each activity and the effect of the progress achieved on the timing of the remaining work, including any changes to the sequence of the activities.\n\n25.3 The Contractor shall submit to the Project Manager for approval an updated Program at intervals no longer than the period stated in the PCC. If the Contractor does not submit an updated Program within this period, the Project Manager may withhold the amount stated in the PCC from the next payment certificate and continue to withhold this amount until the next payment after the date on which the overdue Program has been submitted. In the case of a lump sum contract, the Contractor shall provide an updated Activity Schedule within 14 days of being instructed to by the Project Manager.\n\n25.4 The Project Manager\u2019s approval of the Program shall not alter the Contractor\u2019s obligations.  The Contractor may revise the Program and submit it to the Project Manager again at any time.  A revised Program shall show the effect of Variations and Compensation Events.\n\n\t26. Extension of the Intended Completion Date\n\t26.1 The Project Manager shall extend the Intended Completion Date if a Compensation Event occurs or a Variation is issued which makes it impossible for Completion to be achieved by the Intended Completion Date without the Contractor taking steps to accelerate the remaining work, which would cause the Contractor to incur additional cost.\n\n26.2 The Project Manager shall decide whether and by how much to extend the Intended Completion Date within 21 days of the Contractor asking the Project Manager for a decision upon the effect of a Compensation Event or Variation and submitting full supporting information.  If the Contractor has failed to give early warning of a delay or has failed to cooperate in dealing with a delay, the delay by this failure shall not be considered in assessing the new Intended Completion Date.\n\n\t27. Acceleration\n\t27.1 When the Employer wants the Contractor to finish before the Intended Completion Date, the Project Manager shall obtain priced proposals for achieving the necessary acceleration from the Contractor.  If the Employer accepts these proposals, the Intended Completion Date shall be adjusted accordingly and confirmed by both the Employer and the Contractor.\n\n27.2 If the Contractor\u2019s priced proposals for an acceleration are accepted by the Employer, they are incorporated in the Contract Price and treated as a Variation.\n\n\t28. Delays Ordered by the Project Manager\n\n\n\t28.1 The Project Manager may instruct the Contractor to delay the start or progress of any activity within the Works.\n\n\t29. Management Meetings\n\t29.1 Either the Project Manager or the Contractor may require the other to attend a management meeting.  The business of a management meeting shall be to review the plans for remaining work and to deal with matters raised in accordance with the early warning procedure.\n\n29.2 The Project Manager shall record the business of management meetings and provide copies of the record to those attending the meeting and to the Employer.  The responsibility of the parties for actions to be taken shall be decided by the Project Manager either at the management meeting or after the management meeting and stated in writing to all who attended the meeting.\n\n\t30. Early Warning\n\t30.1 The Contractor shall warn the Project Manager at the earliest opportunity of specific likely future events or circumstances that may adversely affect the quality of the work, increase the Contract Price, or delay the execution of the Works.  The Project Manager may require the Contractor to provide an estimate of the expected effect of the future event or circumstance on the Contract Price and Completion Date.  The estimate shall be provided by the Contractor as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n30.2 The Contractor shall cooperate with the Project Manager in making and considering proposals for how the effect of such an event or circumstance can be avoided or reduced by anyone involved in the work and in carrying out any resulting instruction of the Project Manager.\n\n\nC.  Quality Control\n\n\t31. Identifying Defects\n\t31.1 The Project Manager shall check the Contractor\u2019s work and notify the Contractor of any Defects that are found.  Such checking shall not affect the Contractor\u2019s responsibilities.  The Project Manager may instruct the Contractor to search for a Defect and to uncover and test any work that the Project Manager considers may have a Defect.\n\n\t32. Tests\n\t32.1 If the Project Manager instructs the Contractor to carry out a test not specified in the Specification to check whether any work has a Defect and the test shows that it does, the Contractor shall pay for the test and any samples.  If there is no Defect, the test shall be a Compensation Event.\n\n\t33. Correction of Defects\n\t33.1 The Project Manager shall give notice to the Contractor of any Defects before the end of the Defects Liability Period, which begins at Completion, and is defined in the PCC. The Defects Liability Period shall be extended for as long as Defects remain to be corrected.\n\n33.2 Every time notice of a Defect is given, the Contractor shall correct the notified Defect within the length of time specified by the Project Manager\u2019s notice.\n\n\t34. Uncorrected Defects\n\t34.1 If the Contractor has not corrected a Defect within the time specified in the Project Manager\u2019s notice, the Project Manager shall assess the cost of having the Defect corrected, and the Contractor shall pay this amount.\n\n\nD.  Cost Control\n\n\t35. Contract Price\n\t35.1 In the case of an admeasurement contract, the Bill of Quantities shall contain priced items for the Works to be performed by the Contractor. The Bill of Quantities is used to calculate the Contract Price.  The Contractor will be paid for the quantity of the work accomplished at the rate in the Bill of Quantities for each item.\n\n35.2 In the case of a lump sum contract, the Activity Schedule shall contain the priced activities for the Works to be performed by the Contractor. The Activity Schedule is used to monitor and control the performance of activities on which basis the Contractor will be paid. If payment for Materials on Site shall be made separately, the Contractor shall show delivery of Materials to the Site separately on the Activity Schedule.\n\n\t36. Changes in the Contract Price\n\t36.1 In the case of an admeasurement contract:\n\n(a) If the final quantity of the work done differs from the quantity in the Bill of Quantities for the particular item by more than 25 percent, provided the change exceeds 1 percent of the Initial Contract Price, the Project Manager shall adjust the rate to allow for the change.\n\n(b) The Project Manager shall not adjust rates from changes in quantities if thereby the Initial Contract Price is exceeded by more than 15 percent, except with the prior approval of the Employer.\n\n(c) If requested by the Project Manager, the Contractor shall provide the Project Manager with a detailed cost breakdown of any rate in the Bill of Quantities.\n\n36.2 In the case of a lump sum contract, the Activity Schedule shall be amended by the Contractor to accommodate changes of Program or method of working made at the Contractor\u2019s own discretion.  Prices in the Activity Schedule shall not be altered when the Contractor makes such changes to the Activity Schedule.\n\n\t37. Variations\n\n\n\t37.1 All Variations shall be included in updated Programs, and, in the case of a lump sum contract, also in the Activity Schedule, produced by the Contractor.\n\n37.2 The Contractor shall provide the Project Manager with a quotation for carrying out the Variation when requested to do so by the Project Manager.  The Project Manager shall assess the quotation, which shall be given within seven (7) days of the request or within any longer period stated by the Project Manager and before the Variation is ordered.\n\n37.3 If the Contractor\u2019s quotation is unreasonable, the Project Manager may order the Variation and make a change to the Contract Price, which shall be based on the Project Manager\u2019s own forecast of the effects of the Variation on the Contractor\u2019s costs.\n\n37.4 If the Project Manager decides that the urgency of varying the work would prevent a quotation being given and considered without delaying the work, no quotation shall be given and the Variation shall be treated as a Compensation Event.\n\n37.5 The Contractor shall not be entitled to additional payment for costs that could have been avoided by giving early warning. \n\n37.6 In the case of an admeasurement contract, if the work in the Variation corresponds to an item description in the Bill of Quantities and if, in the opinion of the Project Manager, the quantity of work above the limit stated in Sub-Clause 38.1 or the timing of its execution do not cause the cost per unit of quantity to change, the rate in the Bill of Quantities shall be used to calculate the value of the Variation.  If the cost per unit of quantity changes, or if the nature or timing of the work in the Variation does not correspond with items in the Bill of Quantities, the quotation by the Contractor shall be in the form of new rates for the relevant items of work.\n\n\t38. Cash Flow Forecasts\n\t38.1 When the Program, or, in the case of a lump sum contract, the Activity Schedule, is updated, the Contractor shall provide the Project Manager with an updated cash flow forecast.  The cash flow forecast shall include different currencies, as defined in the Contract, converted as necessary using the Contract exchange rates.\n\n\t39. Payment Certificates\n\t39.1 The Contractor shall submit to the Project Manager monthly statements of the estimated value of the work executed less the cumulative amount certified previously.\n\n39.2 The Project Manager shall check the Contractor\u2019s monthly statement and certify the amount to be paid to the Contractor.\n\n39.3 The value of work executed shall be determined by the Project Manager.\n\n39.4 The value of work executed shall comprise:\n\n(a) In the case of an admeasurement contract, the value of the quantities of work in the Bill of Quantities that have been completed; or\n\n(b) In the case of a lump sum contract, the value of work executed shall comprise the value of completed activities in the Activity Schedule.\n\n39.5 The value of work executed shall include the valuation of Variations and Compensation Events.\n\n39.6 The Project Manager may exclude any item certified in a previous certificate or reduce the proportion of any item previously certified in any certificate in the light of later information.\n\n\t40. Payments\n\t40.1 Payments shall be adjusted for deductions for advance payments and retention.  The Employer shall pay the Contractor the amounts certified by the Project Manager within 28 days of the date of each certificate.  If the Employer makes a late payment, the Contractor shall be paid interest on the late payment in the next payment.  Interest shall be calculated from the date by which the payment should have been made up to the date when the late payment is made at the prevailing rate of interest for commercial borrowing for each of the currencies in which payments are made.\n\n40.2 If an amount certified is increased in a later certificate or as a result of an award by the Adjudicator or an Arbitrator, the Contractor shall be paid interest upon the delayed payment as set out in this clause.  Interest shall be calculated from the date upon which the increased amount would have been certified in the absence of dispute.\n\n40.3 Unless otherwise stated, all payments and deductions shall be paid or charged in the proportions of currencies comprising the Contract Price.\n\n40.4 Items of the Works for which no rate or price has been entered in shall not be paid for by the Employer and shall be deemed covered by other rates and prices in the Contract.\n\n\t41. Compensation Events\n\t41.1 The following shall be Compensation Events:\n\n(a) The Employer does not give access to a part of the Site by the Site Possession Date pursuant to GCC Sub-Clause 20.1.\n\n(b) The Employer modifies the Schedule of Other Contractors in a way that affects the work of the Contractor under the Contract.\n\n(c) The Project Manager orders a delay or does not issue Drawings, Specifications, or instructions required for execution of the Works on time.\n\n(d) The Project Manager instructs the Contractor to uncover or to carry out additional tests upon work, which is then found to have no Defects.\n\n(e) The Project Manager unreasonably does not approve a subcontract to be let.\n\n(f) Ground conditions are substantially more adverse than could reasonably have been assumed before issuance of the Letter of Acceptance from the information issued to bidders (including the Site Investigation Reports), from information available publicly and from a visual inspection of the Site.\n\n(g) The Project Manager gives an instruction for dealing with an unforeseen condition, caused by the Employer, or additional work required for safety or other reasons.\n\n(h) Other contractors, public authorities, utilities, or the Employer does not work within the dates and other constraints stated in the Contract, and they cause delay or extra cost to the Contractor.\n\n(i) The advance payment is delayed.\n\n(j) The effects on the Contractor of any of the Employer\u2019s Risks.\n\n(k) The Project Manager unreasonably delays issuing a Certificate of Completion.\n\n41.2 If a Compensation Event would cause additional cost or would prevent the work being completed before the Intended Completion Date, the Contract Price shall be increased and/or the Intended Completion Date shall be extended.  The Project Manager shall decide whether and by how much the Contract Price shall be increased and whether and by how much the Intended Completion Date shall be extended.\n\n41.3 As soon as information demonstrating the effect of each Compensation Event upon the Contractor\u2019s forecast cost has been provided by the Contractor, it shall be assessed by the Project Manager, and the Contract Price shall be adjusted accordingly.  If the Contractor\u2019s forecast is deemed unreasonable, the Project Manager shall adjust the Contract Price based on the Project Manager\u2019s own forecast.  The Project Manager shall assume that the Contractor shall react competently and promptly to the event.\n\n41.4 The Contractor shall not be entitled to compensation to the extent that the Employer\u2019s interests are adversely affected by the Contractor\u2019s not having given early warning or not having cooperated with the Project Manager.\n\n\t42. Tax\n\t42.1 The Project Manager shall adjust the Contract Price if taxes, duties, and other levies are changed between the date 28 days before the submission of bids for the Contract and the date of the last Completion certificate.  The adjustment shall be the change in the amount of tax payable by the Contractor, provided such changes are not already reflected in the Contract Price or are a result of GCC Clause 44.\n\n\t43. Currencies\n\t43.1 Where payments are made in currencies other than the currency of the Employer\u2019s country specified in the PCC, the exchange rates used for calculating the amounts to be paid shall be the exchange rates stated in the Contractor\u2019s Bid.\n\n\t44. Price Adjustment\n\t44.1 Prices shall be adjusted for fluctuations in the cost of inputs only if provided for in the PCC.  If so provided, the amounts certified in each payment certificate, before deducting for Advance Payment, shall be adjusted by applying the respective price adjustment factor to the payment amounts due in each currency.  A separate formula of the type indicated below applies to each Contract currency:\n\nPc = Ac + Bc Imc/Ioc\nwhere:\n\n\nPc is the adjustment factor for the portion of the Contract Price payable in a specific currency \u201cc.\u201d\n\n\nAc and Bc are coefficients\n specified in the PCC, representing the nonadjustable and adjustable portions, respectively, of the Contract Price payable in that specific currency \u201cc;\u201d and\n\n\nImc is the index prevailing at the end of the month being invoiced and Ioc is the index prevailing 28 days before Bid opening for inputs payable; both in the specific currency \u201cc.\u201d\n\n44.2 If the value of the index is changed after it has been used in a calculation, the calculation shall be corrected and an adjustment made in the next payment certificate.  The index value shall be deemed to take account of all changes in cost due to fluctuations in costs.\n\n\t45. Retention\n\t45.1 The Employer shall retain from each payment due to the Contractor the proportion stated in the PCC until Completion of the whole of the Works.\n\n45.2 Upon the issue of a Certificate of Completion of the Works by the Project Manager, in accordance with GCC 51.1, half the total amount retained shall be repaid to the Contractor and half when the Defects Liability Period has passed and the Project Manager has certified that all Defects notified by the Project Manager to the Contractor before the end of this period have been corrected. The Contractor may substitute retention money with an \u201con demand\u201d Bank guarantee.\n\n\t46. Liquidated Damages\n\t46.1 The Contractor shall pay liquidated damages to the Employer at the rate per day stated in the PCC for each day that the Completion Date is later than the Intended Completion Date.  The total amount of liquidated damages shall not exceed the amount defined in the PCC.  The Employer may deduct liquidated damages from payments due to the Contractor.  Payment of liquidated damages shall not affect the Contractor\u2019s liabilities.\n\n46.2 If the Intended Completion Date is extended after liquidated damages have been paid, the Project Manager shall correct any overpayment of liquidated damages by the Contractor by adjusting the next payment certificate.  The Contractor shall be paid interest on the overpayment, calculated from the date of payment to the date of repayment, at the rates specified in GCC Sub-Clause 40.1.\n\n\t47. Bonus\n\t47.1 The Contractor shall be paid a Bonus calculated at the rate per calendar day stated in the PCC for each day (less any days for which the Contractor is paid for acceleration) that the Completion is earlier than the Intended Completion Date.  The Project Manager shall certify that the Works are complete, although they may not be due to be complete.\n\n\t48. Advance Payment\n\t48.1 The Employer shall make advance payment to the Contractor of the amounts stated in the PCC by the date stated in the PCC, against provision by the Contractor of an Unconditional Bank Guarantee in a form and by a bank acceptable to the Employer in amounts and currencies equal to the advance payment.  The Guarantee shall remain effective until the advance payment has been repaid, but the amount of the Guarantee shall be progressively reduced by the amounts repaid by the Contractor.  Interest shall not be charged on the advance payment.\n\n48.2 The Contractor is to use the advance payment only to pay for Equipment, Plant, Materials, and mobilization expenses required specifically for execution of the Contract.  The Contractor shall demonstrate that advance payment has been used in this way by supplying copies of invoices or other documents to the Project Manager.\n\n48.3 The advance payment shall be repaid by deducting proportionate amounts from payments otherwise due to the Contractor, following the schedule of completed percentages of the Works on a payment basis.  No account shall be taken of the advance payment or its repayment in assessing valuations of work done, Variations, price adjustments, Compensation Events, Bonuses, or Liquidated Damages.\n\n\t49. Securities\n\t49.1 The Performance Security shall be provided to the Employer no later than the date specified in the Letter of Acceptance and shall be issued in an amount specified in the PCC, by a bank or surety acceptable to the Employer, and denominated in the types and proportions of the currencies in which the Contract Price is payable.  The Performance Security shall be valid until a date 28 days from the date of issue of the Certificate of Completion in the case of a Bank Guarantee, and until one year from the date of issue of the Completion Certificate in the case of a Performance Bond.\n\n\t50. Dayworks\n\t50.1 If applicable, the Dayworks rates in the Contractor\u2019s Bid shall be used only when the Project Manager has given written instructions in advance for additional work to be paid for in that way.\n\n50.2 All work to be paid for as Dayworks shall be recorded by the Contractor on forms approved by the Project Manager.  Each completed form shall be verified and signed by the Project Manager within two days of the work being done.\n\n50.3 The Contractor shall be paid for Dayworks subject to obtaining signed Dayworks forms.\n\n\t51. Cost of Repairs\n\t51.1 Loss or damage to the Works or Materials to be incorporated in the Works between the Start Date and the end of the Defects Correction periods shall be remedied by the Contractor at the Contractor\u2019s cost if the loss or damage arises from the Contractor\u2019s acts or omissions.\n\n\nE.  Finishing the Contract\n\n\t52.

The Project Manager shall issue a Defects Liability Certificate and certify any final payment that is due to the Contractor within 56 days of receiving the Contractor\u2019s account if it is correct and complete.  If it is not, the Project Manager shall issue within 56 days a schedule that states the scope of the corrections or additions that are necessary.  If the Final Account is still unsatisfactory after it has been resubmitted, the Project Manager shall decide on the amount payable to the Contractor and issue a payment certificate.\n\n\t55. Operating and Maintenance Manuals\n\t55.1 If \u201cas built\u201d Drawings and/or operating and maintenance manuals are required, the Contractor shall supply them by the dates stated in the PCC.\n55.2 If the Contractor does not supply the Drawings and/or manuals by the dates stated in the PCC pursuant to GCC Sub-Clause 55.1, or they do not receive the Project Manager\u2019s approval, the Project Manager shall withhold the amount stated in the PCC from payments due to the Contractor.\n\n\t56.

A material deviation, reservation, or omission is one that:\n\n(a) affects in any substantial way the scope, quality, or performance of the Goods and Related Services specified in the Contract; or\n\n(b) limits in any substantial way, inconsistent with the Bidding Documents, the Procuring Entity\u2019s rights or the Bidder\u2019s obligations under the Contract; or\n\n(c) if rectified would unfairly affect the competitive position of other bidders presenting substantially responsive bids.\n\n28.3 If a bid is not substantially responsive to the Bidding Documents, it shall be rejected by the Procuring Entity and may not subsequently be made responsive by the Bidder by correction of the material deviation, reservation, or omission.\n\n\t29 Non-conformities, Errors, and Omissions\n\n\t29.1 Provided that a Bid is substantially responsive, the Procuring Entity may waive any non-conformities or omissions in the Bid that do not constitute a material deviation.\n\n29.2 Provided that a bid is substantially responsive, the Procuring Entity may request that the Bidder submit the necessary information or documentation, within a reasonable period of time, to rectify nonmaterial nonconformities or omissions in the bid related to documentation requirements.  Such omission shall not be related to any aspect of the price of the Bid.  Failure of the Bidder to comply with the request may result in the rejection of its Bid.\n\n29.3 Provided that the Bid is substantially responsive, the Procuring Entity shall correct arithmetical errors on the following basis:\n\n(a) if there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the line item total that is obtained by multiplying the unit price by the quantity, the unit price shall prevail and the line item total shall be corrected, unless in the opinion of the Procuring Entity there is an obvious misplacement of the decimal point in the unit price, in which case the line item total  as quoted shall govern and the unit price shall be corrected;\n\n(b) if there is an error in a total corresponding to the addition or subtraction of subtotals, the subtotals shall prevail and the total shall be corrected; and\n\n(c) if there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words shall prevail, unless the amount expressed in words is related to an arithmetic error, in which case the amount in figures shall prevail subject to (a) and (b) above.\n\n29.4 If the Bidder that submitted the best-evaluated Bid does not accept the correction of errors, its Bid shall be disqualified and its Bid Security may be forfeited or its Bid-Securing Declaration executed.\n\n\n\t30 Preliminary Examination of Bids\n\n\t30.1 The Procuring Entity shall examine the bids to confirm that all documents and technical documentation requested in ITB Clause 11 have been provided, and to determine the completeness of each document submitted.\n\n30.2 The Procuring Entity shall confirm that the following documents and information have been provided in the Bid.

INTRODUCTION\nThe Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) stands as a pivotal institution with a nationwide presence, boasting over 40 strategically located stations across the country. At the heart of its operational infrastructure lie robust Local Area Networks (LANs) seamlessly interconnected via a Wide Area Network (WAN). These networks serve as the digital backbone facilitating the essential exchange of resources and information vital to ZRA's mandate.\n\nIn this interconnected ecosystem, users leverage the LANs to access and share a plethora of resources critical to their daily operations. From IP Phones ensuring seamless communication to Printers facilitating document management, File Servers housing essential data repositories, to the centralized tax systems streamlining revenue collection processes, the LANs play a pivotal role in ZRA's day-to-day functions.\n\nAs ZRA continues its unwavering commitment to collect taxes efficiently and effectively, the institution has witnessed a surge in demand for network resources across various stations and departments. This surge is a direct consequence of ZRA's proactive approach in bolstering its workforce, strategically positioning personnel to enhance service delivery and optimize revenue collection efforts.\n\nThe burgeoning demand for network resources, including data points and the imperative to expand the wireless LAN infrastructure, underscores ZRA's dynamic operational landscape. To meet these evolving demands and ensure seamless connectivity and resource accessibility across all stations, ZRA is embarking on a comprehensive LAN upgrade initiative. This initiative seeks to modernize the existing network infrastructure, augmenting its capacity and capabilities to accommodate the burgeoning workforce and facilitate efficient service delivery in line with ZRA's overarching objectives.\n2. SCOPE OF WORK\nThe scope of work shall include supply and delivery of LAN materials for use in installation, expansion and maintenance of the LAN and Wireless Access Points to be deployed on the AirNet WLAN. \n\n3.

For the remaining Goods, the Procuring Entity may elect: \n\n(i) to have any portion completed and delivered at the Contract terms and prices; and/or\n\n(ii) to cancel the remainder and pay to the Supplier an agreed amount for partially completed Goods and Related Services and for materials and parts previously procured by the Supplier.\n\n\n\t32 Assignment\n\n\t32.1 Neither the Procuring Entity nor the Supplier shall assign, in whole or in part, their obligations under this Contract, except with prior written consent of the other party.\n\n\n\tSection VIII.

Once the maximum is reached, the Procuring Entity may terminate the Contract pursuant to GCC Clause 31.\n\n\t25 Warranty\n\n\t25.1 The Supplier warrants that all the Goods are new, unused, and of the most recent or current models, and that they incorporate all recent improvements in design and materials, unless provided otherwise in the Contract.\n\n25.2 Subject to GCC Sub-Clause 20.1(b), the Supplier further warrants that the Goods shall be free from defects arising from any act or omission of the Supplier or arising from design, materials, and workmanship, under normal use in the conditions prevailing in the country of final destination.\n\n25.3 Unless otherwise specified in the SCC, the warranty shall remain valid for twelve (12) months after the Goods, or any portion thereof as the case may be, have been delivered to and accepted at the final destination indicated in the SCC, or for eighteen (18) months after the date of shipment from the port or place of loading in the country of origin, whichever period concludes earlier.\n\n25.4 The Procuring Entity shall give notice to the Supplier stating the nature of any such defects together with all available evidence thereof, promptly following the discovery thereof.  The Procuring Entity shall afford all reasonable opportunity for the Supplier to inspect such defects.\n\n25.5 Upon receipt of such notice, the Supplier shall, within the period specified in the SCC, expeditiously repair or replace the defective Goods or parts thereof, at no cost to the Procuring Entity.\n\n25.6 If having been notified, the Supplier fails to remedy the defect within the period specified in the SCC, the Procuring Entity may proceed to take within a reasonable period such remedial action as may be necessary, at the Supplier\u2019s risk and expense and without prejudice to any other rights which the Procuring Entity may have against the Supplier under the Contract.\n\n\t26 Patent Indemnity\n\n\t26.1 The Supplier shall, subject to the Procuring Entity\u2019s compliance with GCC Sub-Clause 26.2, indemnify and hold harmless the Procuring Entity and its employees and officers from and against any and all suits, actions or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, losses, damages, costs, and expenses of any nature, including attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, which the Procuring Entity may suffer as a result of any infringement or alleged infringement of any patent, utility model, registered design, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property right registered or otherwise existing at the date of the Contract by reason of:  \n\n(a) the installation of the Goods by the Supplier or the use of the Goods in the country where the Site is located; and \n\n(b) the sale in any country of the products produced by the Goods. \n\nSuch indemnity shall not cover any use of the Goods or any part thereof other than for the purpose indicated by or to be reasonably inferred from the Contract, neither any infringement resulting from the use of the Goods or any part thereof, or any products produced thereby in association or combination with any other equipment, plant, or materials not supplied by the Supplier, pursuant to the Contract.\n\n26.2 If any proceedings are brought or any claim is made against the Procuring Entity arising out of the matters referred to in GCC Sub-Clause 26.1, the Procuring Entity shall promptly give the Supplier a notice thereof, and the Supplier may at its own expense and in the Procuring Entity\u2019s name conduct such proceedings or claim and any negotiations for the settlement of any such proceedings or claim.\n\n26.3 If the Supplier fails to notify the Procuring Entity within twenty-eight (28) days after receipt of such notice that it intends to conduct any such proceedings or claim, then the Procuring Entity shall be free to conduct the same on its own behalf.\n\n26.4 The Procuring Entity shall, at the Supplier\u2019s request, afford all available assistance to the Supplier in conducting such proceedings or claim, and shall be reimbursed by the Supplier for all reasonable expenses incurred in so doing.\n\n26.5 The Procuring Entity shall indemnify and hold harmless the Supplier and its employees, officers, and Subcontractors from and against any and all suits, actions or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, losses, damages, costs, and expenses of any nature, including attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, which the Supplier may suffer as a result of any infringement or alleged infringement of any patent, utility model, registered design, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property right registered or otherwise existing at the date of the Contract arising out of or in connection with any design, data, drawing, specification, or other documents or materials provided or designed by or on behalf of the Procuring Entity.\n\n\t27 Change in Laws and Regulations\n\n\t27.1 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, if after the date of 28 days prior to date of Bid submission, any law, regulation, ordinance, order or bylaw having the force of law is enacted, promulgated, abrogated, or changed in Zambia (which shall be deemed to include any change in interpretation or application by the competent authorities) that subsequently affects the Delivery Date and/or the Contract Price, then such Delivery Date and/or Contract Price shall be correspondingly increased or decreased, to the extent that the Supplier has thereby been affected in the performance of any of its obligations under the Contract.  \n\n\t28 Force Majeure\n\n\t28.1 The Supplier shall not be liable for forfeiture of its Performance Security, liquidated damages, or termination for default if and to the extent that its delay in performance or other failure to perform its obligations under the Contract is the result of an event of Force Majeure.\n\n28.2 For purposes of this Clause, \u201cForce Majeure\u201d means an event or situation beyond the control of the Supplier that is not foreseeable, is unavoidable, and its origin is not due to negligence or lack of care on the part of the Supplier.
