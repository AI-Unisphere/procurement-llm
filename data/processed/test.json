Clarification of Bids\n\n\n\tTo assist in the examination, evaluation, and comparison of the bids, and qualification of the Bidders, the Employer may, at its discretion, ask any Bidder for a clarification of its bid.

Determination of Responsiveness \n\t29.1 The Employer\u2019s determination of a bid\u2019s responsiveness is to be based on the contents of the bid itself, as defined in ITB11.\n\n\t\n\t29.2 A substantially responsive bid is one that meets the requirements of the Bidding Document without material deviation, reservation, or omission. A material deviation, reservation, or omission is one that,\n\n(a)\nif accepted, would:\n\n(i)\naffect in any substantial way the scope, quality, or performance of the Works specified in the Contract; or\n\n(ii)\nlimit in any substantial way, inconsistent with the Bidding Document, the Employer\u2019s rights or the Bidder\u2019s obligations under the proposed Contract; or\n\n(b)\nif rectified, would unfairly affect the competitive position of other Bidders presenting substantially responsive bids.\n\n\t\n\t29.3 The Employer shall examine the technical aspects of the bid submitted in accordance with ITB 16, Technical Proposal, in particular, to confirm that all requirements of Section 6 (Employer\u2019s Requirements) have been met without any material deviation, reservation or omission.\n\n\t\n\tIf a bid is not substantially responsive to the requirements of the Bidding Document, it shall be rejected by the Employer and may not subsequently be made responsive by correction of the material deviation, reservation, or omission.\n\n\t30. Nonconformities, Errors, and Omissions\n\tProvided that a bid is substantially responsive, the Employer may waive any nonconformities in the bid.\n\n\t\n\tProvided that a bid is substantially responsive, the Employer may request that the Bidder submit the necessary information or documentation, within a reasonable period of time, to rectify nonmaterial nonconformities in the bid related to documentation requirements. Requesting information or documentation on such nonconformities shall not be related to any aspect of the price of the bid. Failure of the Bidder to comply with the request may result in the rejection of its bid.\n\n\t\n\tProvided that a bid is substantially responsive, the Employer shall rectify quantifiable nonmaterial nonconformities related to the Bid Price. To this effect, the Bid Price may be adjusted, for comparison purposes only, to reflect the price of a missing or non-conforming item or component. The adjustment shall be made using the methods indicated in Section III (Evaluation and Qualification Criteria).\n\n\t31. Correction of Arithmetical Errors\n\tProvided that the bid is substantially responsive, the Employer shall correct arithmetical errors on the following basis:\n\n(a)\nonly for unit price contracts, if there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total price that is obtained by multiplying the unit price and quantity, the unit price shall prevail and the total price shall be corrected, unless in the opinion of the Employer there is an obvious misplacement of the decimal point in the unit price, in which case the total price as quoted shall govern and the unit price shall be corrected;\n\n(b)\nif there is an error in a total corresponding to the addition or subtraction of subtotals, the subtotals shall prevail and the total shall be corrected; and\n\n(c)\nif there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words shall prevail, unless the amount expressed in words is related to an arithmetic error, in which case the amount in figures shall prevail subject to (a) and (b) above.\n\n\t\n\tIf the Bidder that submitted the best-evaluated bid does not accept the correction of errors, its bid shall be declared non-responsive.\n\n\t32. Conversion to Single Currency \n\tFor evaluation and comparison purposes, the currency(ies) of the bid shall be converted into a single currency as specified in the BDS.   \n\n\t33. Margin of Preference\n\t33.1 A margin of preference shall not apply, unless otherwise specified in the BDS.\nDomestic bidders shall provide all evidence necessary to prove that they meet the following criteria to be eligible for a 7\u00bd percent margin of preference in the comparison of their bids with those of bidders who do not qualify for the preference.  They should:\n\n(a)\nbe registered within the country of the Employer\u2019s country ;\n\n(b)\nhave majority ownership by nationals of the country of the Employer\u2019s country ;\n\n(c)\nnot subcontract more than 10 percent of the Contract Price, excluding provisional sums, to foreign contractors.\n\n33.3\nThe following procedure shall be used to apply the margin of preference:\n\n(a)\nResponsive bids shall be classified into the following groups:\n\n(i)\nGroup A:  bids offered by domestic bidders and joint ventures meeting the criteria of ITB Sub-Clause 33.2; and\n\n(ii)\nGroup B:  all other bids.\n\n(b)\nFor the purpose of further evaluation and comparison of bids only, an amount equal to 7\u00bd percent of the evaluated Bid prices determined in accordance with ITB Sub-Clause 33.2 shall be added to all bids classified in Group B.\n\n\t34. Evaluation of Bids\n\t34.1 The Employer shall use the criteria and methodologies listed in this Clause. No other evaluation criteria or methodologies shall be permitted.\n\n\t\n\t34.2 To evaluate a bid, the Employer shall consider the following:\n\n(a)\nthe bid price, excluding Provisional Sums and the provision, if any, for contingencies in the Summary Bill of Quantities for admeasurement contracts or Schedule of Prices for lump sum contracts, but including Daywork items, where priced competitively;\n\n(b)\nprice adjustment for correction of arithmetic errors in accordance with ITB 31.1;\n\n(c)\nprice adjustment due to discounts offered in accordance with ITB 14.3;\n\n(d)\nconverting the amount resulting from applying (a) to (c) above, if relevant, to a single currency in accordance with ITB 32;\n(e)\nadjustment for nonconformities in accordance with ITB 30.3;\n\n(f)\napplication of all the evaluation factors indicated in Section III (Evaluation and Qualification Criteria);\n\n\t\n\t34.3 The estimated effect of the price adjustment provisions of the Conditions of Contract, applied over the period of execution of the Contract, shall not be taken into account in bid evaluation.\n\n\t\n\t34.4 If this Bidding Document allows Bidders to quote separate prices for different contracts, and to award multiple contracts to a single Bidder, the methodology to determine the best-evaluated price of the contract combinations, including any discounts offered in the Letter of Bid, is specified in Section III (Evaluation and Qualification Criteria).\n\n\t\n\t34.5 If the bid for an admeasurement contract, which results in the best-evaluated Bid Price, is seriously unbalanced, front loaded or substantially below updated estimates in the opinion of the Employer, the Employer may require the Bidder to produce detailed price analyses for any or all items of the Bill of Quantities, to demonstrate the internal consistency of those prices with the construction methods and schedule proposed. After evaluation of the price analyses, taking into consideration the schedule of estimated Contract payments, the Employer may require that the amount of the performance security be increased at the expense of the Bidder to a level sufficient to protect the Employer against financial loss in the event of default of the successful Bidder under the Contract.\n\n\t35. Comparison of Bids\n\t35.1 The Employer shall compare all substantially responsive bids in accordance with ITB 34.2 to determine the best-evaluated bid.\n\n\t36. Qualification of the Bidder\n\t36.1 The Employer shall determine to its satisfaction whether the Bidder that is selected as having submitted the best-evaluated and substantially responsive bid meets the qualifying criteria specified in Section III (Evaluation and Qualification Criteria).\n\n\t\n\t36.2 The determination shall be based upon an examination of the documentary evidence of the Bidder\u2019s qualifications submitted by the Bidder, pursuant to ITB 17.1.\n\n\t\n\t36.3 An affirmative determination of qualification shall be a prerequisite for award of the Contract to the Bidder. A negative determination shall result in disqualification of the bid, in which event the Employer shall proceed to the next best-evaluated bid to make a similar determination of that Bidder\u2019s qualifications to perform satisfactorily.\n\n\t37. Employer\u2019s Right to Accept Any Bid, and to Reject Any or All Bids\n\t37.1 The Employer reserves the right to accept or reject any bid, and to annul the bidding process and reject all bids at any time prior to contract award, without thereby incurring any liability to Bidders. In case of annulment, all bids submitted and specifically, bid securities, shall be promptly returned to the Bidders.\n\n\tF. Award of Contract\n\n\t38. Award Criteria\n\t38.1 Subject to ITB 37.1, the Employer shall award the Contract to the Bidder whose offer has been determined to be the best-evaluated bid and is substantially responsive to the Bidding Document, provided further that the Bidder is determined to be qualified to perform the Contract satisfactorily.\n\n\t39. Notification of Award\n\t39.1 Prior to the expiration of the period of bid validity, the Employer shall notify the successful Bidder, in writing, via the Letter of Acceptance included in the Contract Forms, that its bid has been accepted.  At the same time, the Employer shall also notify all other Bidders of the results of the bidding, and shall publish on the electronic Government Procurement Platform the results identifying the bid and lot numbers and the following information: (i) name of each Bidder who submitted a Bid; (ii) bid prices as read out at Bid Opening; (iii) name and evaluated prices of each Bid that was evaluated; (iv) name of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (v) name of the winning Bidder, and the Price it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract awarded.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tThe Employer shall promptly respond in writing to any unsuccessful Bidder who, after notification of award in accordance with ITB 39.1, requests in writing the grounds on which its bid was not selected.\n\n\t40. Signing of Contract\n\t40.1 Promptly upon notification, the Employer shall send the successful Bidder the Contract Agreement.\n\n\t\n\t40.2 Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the Contract Agreement, the successful Bidder shall sign, date, and return it to the Employer.\n\n\t41. Performance Security\n\t41.1 Within twenty-one (21) days of the receipt of notification of award from the Employer, the successful Bidder shall furnish the performance security in accordance with the conditions of contract, subject to ITB 34.5, using for that purpose the Performance Security Form included in Section IX (Contract Forms), or another form acceptable to the Employer.  If the performance security furnished by the successful Bidder is in the form of a bond, it shall be issued by a bonding or insurance company that has been determined by the successful Bidder to be acceptable to the Employer. A foreign institution providing a bond shall have a correspondent financial institution located in the Employer\u2019s Country.\n\n\t\n\t41.2 Failure of the successful Bidder to submit the above-mentioned Performance Security or to sign the Contract Agreement shall constitute sufficient grounds for the annulment of the award and forfeiture of the bid security. In that event the Employer may award the Contract to the next best-evaluated Bidder whose offer is substantially responsive and is determined by the Employer to be qualified to perform the Contract satisfactorily.\n\n\t\n\t41.3 The above provision shall also apply to the furnishing of a domestic preference security if so required.\n\n\t42. Adjudicator\n\t42.1 The Employer proposes the person named in the BDS to be appointed as Adjudicator under the Contract, at the hourly fee specified in the BDS, plus reimbursable expenses.  If the Bidder disagrees with this proposal, the Bidder should so state in his Bid.

As an exception, firms of a Country or goods manufactured in a Country may be excluded if:\n\n(i): as a matter of law or official regulation, Government prohibits commercial relations with that Country, provided that Cooperating Partners involved are satisfied that such exclusion does not preclude effective competition for the supply of the Goods or Works required, or \n\n(ii): by an Act of Compliance with a Decision of the United Nations Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, the Government prohibits any import of goods from that Country or any payments to persons or entities in that Country.\n\n2. For the information of bidders, at the present time firms, goods and services from the following countries are excluded from this bidding:\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\nPART 2 \u2013 Employer\u2019s Requirements\n\nSection VI - Employer\u2019s Requirements\nTable of Contents\n\n2Specifications (Terms of Reference)\n2-\n\n3Drawings\n2-\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nBackground\n\nThe Rural Electrification Authority (REA) is a statutory body created by an Act of Parliament, the Rural Electrification Act No. 20 of 2003 (repealed by the Rural Electrification Act No. 5 of 2023), as a special-purpose vehicle to champion the rural electrification program in Zambia. In undertaking this program, REA implements various rural electrification projects using various technologies such as the extension of the national grid, mini-hydro power generation, Photo Voltaic (PV) Solar systems, and off-grid solar mini-grid plants, and other renewable energy systems such as Biomass and wind.\n\nIn this regard, the Authority has developed the Kasanjiku Mini Hydro Power Plant in Ntambu village of Mwinilunga District. The area is located 210 kilometres from Solwezi. The power plant provides electricity to Chief Ntambu and Chief Sialunga\u2019s chiefdoms. The Plant is located outside the coverage of the three mobile networks and this has made communication with people at the plant very difficult.\n\nConsidering the location of the plant, it is unlikely that any of the mobile operators would be extending coverage in the area any time soon. To improve communication, there is a need to boost the mobile network signals in the area to reach the power plant and this will require the installation of a repeater and the construction of a 24-meter mast near the staff houses at the power plant. This will boost the mobile network for all networks to cover a radius of 5 Kilometers. In addition, there is also a need to extend the coverage of the internet from the Multi-Facility Zone to the staff houses.

Extension of the Intended Completion Date\n\t25.1 The Project Manager shall extend the Intended Completion Date if a Compensation Event occurs or a Variation is issued which makes it impossible for Completion to be achieved by the Intended Completion Date without the Contractor taking steps to accelerate the remaining work, which would cause the Contractor to incur additional cost.\n\n25.2 The Project Manager shall decide whether and by how much to extend the Intended Completion Date within 21 days of the Contractor asking the Project Manager for a decision upon the effect of a Compensation Event or Variation and submitting full supporting information.  If the Contractor has failed to give early warning of a delay or has failed to cooperate in dealing with a delay, the delay by this failure shall not be considered in assessing the new Intended Completion Date.\n\n\t26. Acceleration\n\t26.1 When the Procuring Entity wants the Contractor to finish before the Intended Completion Date, the Project Manager shall obtain priced proposals for achieving the necessary acceleration from the Contractor.  If the Procuring Entity accepts these proposals, the Intended Completion Date shall be adjusted accordingly and confirmed by both the Procuring Entity and the Contractor.\n\n26.2 If the Contractor\u2019s priced proposals for an acceleration are accepted by the Procuring Entity, they shall be incorporated in the Contract Price and treated as a Variation.\n\n\t27. Delays Ordered by the Project Manager\n\n\n\t27.1 The Project Manager may instruct the Contractor to delay the start or progress of any activity within the Works.\n\n\t28. Management Meetings\n\t28.1 Either the Project Manager or the Contractor may require the other to attend a management meeting.  The business of a management meeting shall be to review the plans for remaining work and to deal with matters raised in accordance with the early warning procedure.\n\n28.2 The Project Manager shall record the business of management meetings and provide copies of the record to those attending the meeting and to the Procuring Entity.  The responsibility of the parties for actions to be taken shall be decided by the Project Manager either at the management meeting or after the management meeting and stated in writing to all who attended the meeting.\n\n\t29. Early Warning\n\t29.1 The Contractor shall warn the Project Manager within five (5) days of specific likely future events or circumstances that may adversely affect the quality of the work, increase the Contract Price, or delay the execution of the Works.  The Project Manager may require the Contractor to provide an estimate of the expected effect of the future event or circumstance on the Contract Price and Completion Date.  The estimate shall be provided by the Contractor as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n29.2 The Contractor shall cooperate with the Project Manager in making and considering proposals for how the effect of such an event or circumstance can be avoided or reduced by anyone involved in the work and in carrying out any resulting instruction of the Project Manager.\n\n\n\n\nC.  Quality Control\n\n\t30. Identifying Defects\n\t30.1 The Project Manager shall check the Contractor\u2019s work and notify the Contractor of any Defects that are found.  Such checking shall not affect the Contractor\u2019s responsibilities.  The Project Manager may instruct the Contractor to search for a Defect and to uncover and test any work that the Project Manager considers may have a Defect.\n\n\t31. Tests\n\t31.1 If the Project Manager instructs the Contractor to carry out a test not specified in the Specification to check whether any work has a Defect and the test shows that it does, the Contractor shall pay for the test and any samples.  If there is no Defect, the test shall be a Compensation Event.\n\n\t32. Correction of Defects\n\t32.1 The Project Manager shall give notice to the Contractor of any Defects before the end of the Defects Liability Period, which begins at Completion, and is defined in the PCC. The Defects Liability Period shall be extended for as long as Defects remain to be corrected.\n\n32.2 Every time notice of a Defect is given, the Contractor shall correct the notified Defect within the length of time specified by the Project Manager\u2019s notice.\n\n\t33. Uncorrected Defects\n\t33.1 If the Contractor has not corrected a Defect within the time specified in the Project Manager\u2019s notice, the Project Manager shall assess the cost of having the Defect corrected, and the Contractor shall pay this amount.\n\n\nD.  Cost Control\n\n\t34. Contract Price\n\t34.1 In the case of an admeasurement contract, the Bill of Quantities shall contain priced items for the Works to be performed by the Contractor. The Bill of Quantities is used to calculate the Contract Price.  The Contractor will be paid for the quantity of the work accomplished at the rate in the Bill of Quantities for each item.\n\n34.2 In the case of a lump sum contract, the Activity Schedule shall contain the priced activities for the Works to be performed by the Contractor. The Activity Schedule is used to monitor and control the performance of activities on which basis the Contractor will be paid. If payment for Materials on Site shall be made separately, the Contractor shall show delivery of Materials to the Site separately on the Activity Schedule.\n\n\t35. Changes in the Contract Price\n\t35.1 In the case of an admeasurement contract:\n\n(a) If the final quantity of the work done differs from the quantity in the Bill of Quantities for the particular item by more than 25 percent, provided the change exceeds 1 percent of the Initial Contract Price, the Project Manager shall adjust the rate to allow for the change.\n\n(b) The Project Manager shall not adjust rates from changes in quantities if thereby the Initial Contract Price is exceeded by more than 15 percent, except with the prior approval of the Procuring Entity.\n\n(c) If requested by the Project Manager, the Contractor shall provide the Project Manager with a detailed cost breakdown of any rate in the Bill of Quantities.\n\n35.2 In the case of a lump sum contract, the Activity Schedule shall be amended by the Contractor to accommodate changes of Program or method of working made at the Contractor\u2019s own discretion.  Prices in the Activity Schedule shall not be altered when the Contractor makes such changes to the Activity Schedule.\n\n\t36. Variations\n\n\n\t36.1 All Variations shall be included in updated Programs, and, in the case of a lump sum contract, also in the Activity Schedule, produced by the Contractor.\n\n36.2 The Contractor shall provide the Project Manager with a quotation for carrying out the Variation when requested to do so by the Project Manager.  The Project Manager shall assess the quotation, which shall be given within seven (7) days of the request or within any longer period stated by the Project Manager and before the Variation is ordered.\n\n36.3 If the Contractor\u2019s quotation is unreasonable, the Project Manager may order the Variation and make a change to the Contract Price, which shall be based on the Project Manager\u2019s own forecast of the effects of the Variation on the Contractor\u2019s costs.\n\n36.4 If the Project Manager decides that the urgency of varying the work would prevent a quotation being given and considered without delaying the work, no quotation shall be given and the Variation shall be treated as a Compensation Event.\n\n36.5 The Contractor shall not be entitled to additional payment for costs that could have been avoided by giving early warning. \n\n36.6 In the case of an admeasurement contract, if the work in the Variation corresponds to an item description in the Bill of Quantities and if, in the opinion of the Project Manager, the quantity of work above the limit stated in Sub-Clause 38.1 or the timing of its execution do not cause the cost per unit of quantity to change, the rate in the Bill of Quantities shall be used to calculate the value of the Variation.  If the cost per unit of quantity changes, or if the nature or timing of the work in the Variation does not correspond with items in the Bill of Quantities, the quotation by the Contractor shall be in the form of new rates for the relevant items of work.\n\n\t\n\t36.7 The cumulative value of a Contract variation shall not result in an increment of the total price by more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the original contract price as prescribed, except that where the variation results in an increment exceeding twenty-five percent (25%), the contract shall be cancelled and the procurement re-tendered. \n\n36.8 The Procuring Entity shall, where a variation results in a change in price, commit the additional funds before issue of the variation, unless those funds are already provided by any committed amount for contingencies or similar matters.\n\n\t37. Cash Flow Forecasts\n\t37.1 When the Program, or, in the case of a lump sum contract, the Activity Schedule, is updated, the Contractor shall provide the Project Manager with an updated cash flow forecast.  The cash flow forecast shall include different currencies, as defined in the Contract, converted as necessary using the Contract exchange rates.\n\n\t38. Payment Certificates\n\t38.1 The Contractor shall submit to the Project Manager monthly statements of the estimated value of the work executed less the cumulative amount certified previously.\n\n38.2 The Project Manager shall check the Contractor\u2019s monthly statement and certify the amount to be paid to the Contractor.\n\n38.3 The value of work executed shall be determined by the Project Manager.\n\n38.4 The value of work executed shall comprise:\n\n(a) In the case of an admeasurement contract, the value of the quantities of work in the Bill of Quantities that have been completed; or\n\n(b) In the case of a lump sum contract, the value of work executed shall comprise the value of completed activities in the Activity Schedule.\n\n38.5 The value of work executed shall include the valuation of Variations and Compensation Events.\n\n38.6 The Project Manager may exclude any item certified in a previous certificate or reduce the proportion of any item previously certified in any certificate in the light of later information.\n\n\t39. Payments\n\t39.1 Payments shall be adjusted for deductions for advance payments and retention.  The Procuring Entity shall pay the Contractor the amounts certified by the Project Manager within 28 days of the date of each certificate.  \n\n39.2 Unless otherwise stated, all payments and deductions shall be paid or charged in the proportions of currencies comprising the Contract Price \n39.3 Items of the Works for which no rate or price has been entered in shall not be paid for by the Procuring Entity and shall be deemed covered by other rates and prices in the Contract.\n\n\t40. Compensation Events\n\t40.1 The following shall be Compensation Events:\n\n(a) The Procuring Entity does not give access to a part of the Site by the Site Possession Date pursuant to GCC Sub-Clause 20.1.\n\n(b) The Procuring Entity modifies the Schedule of Other Contractors in a way that affects the work of the Contractor under the Contract.\n\n(c) The Project Manager orders a delay or does not issue Drawings, Specifications, or instructions required for execution of the Works on time.\n\n(d) The Project Manager instructs the Contractor to uncover or to carry out additional tests upon work, which is then found to have no Defects.\n\n(e) The Project Manager unreasonably does not approve a subcontract to be let.\n\n(f) Ground conditions are substantially more adverse than could reasonably have been assumed before issuance of the Letter of Acceptance from the information issued to bidders (including the Site Investigation Reports), from information available publicly and from a visual inspection of the Site.\n\n(g) The Project Manager gives an instruction for dealing with an unforeseen condition, caused by the Procuring Entity, or additional work required for safety or other reasons.\n\n(h) Other contractors, public authorities, utilities, or the Procuring Entity does not work within the dates and other constraints stated in the Contract, and they cause delay or extra cost to the Contractor.\n\n(i) The effects on the Contractor of any of the Procuring Entity\u2019s Risks.  \n(j) The effects on the Contractor of any of the Procuring Entity\u2019s Risks.\n\n40.2 If a Compensation Event would cause additional cost or would prevent the work being completed before the Intended Completion Date, the Contract Price shall be increased and/or the Intended Completion Date shall be extended.  The Project Manager shall decide whether and by how much the Contract Price shall be increased and whether and by how much the Intended Completion Date shall be extended.\n\n40.3 As soon as information demonstrating the effect of each Compensation Event upon the Contractor\u2019s forecast cost has been provided by the Contractor, it shall be assessed by the Project Manager, and the Contract Price shall be adjusted accordingly.  If the Contractor\u2019s forecast is deemed unreasonable, the Project Manager shall adjust the Contract Price based on the Project Manager\u2019s own forecast.  The Project Manager shall assume that the Contractor shall react competently and promptly to the event.\n\n40.4 The Contractor shall not be entitled to compensation to the extent that the Procuring Entity\u2019s interests are adversely affected by the Contractor\u2019s not having given early warning or not having cooperated with the Project Manager.\n\n\t41. Tax\n\t41.1 All tax exemptions shall be in accordance with the appropriate tax laws in the Republic of Zambia as amended from time to time.\n\n41.2 The Project Manager shall adjust the Contract Price if taxes, duties, and other levies are changed between the date 28 days before the submission of bids for the Contract and the date of the last Completion certificate.  The adjustment shall be the change in the amount of tax payable by the Contractor, provided such changes are not already reflected in the Contract Price or are a result of GCC Clause 43.\n\n\t42. Currencies\n\t42.1 Where payments are made in currencies other than the currency of the Procuring Entity\u2019s country specified in the PCC, the exchange rates used for calculating the amounts to be paid shall be the exchange rates stated in the Contractor\u2019s Bid.\n\n\t43. Price Adjustment\n\t43.1 Prices shall be adjusted for fluctuations in the cost of inputs only if provided for in the PCC.  If so provided, the amounts certified in each payment certificate, before deducting for Advance Payment, shall be adjusted by applying the respective price adjustment factor to the payment amounts due in each currency.  A separate formula of the type indicated below applies to each Contract currency:\n\nPc = Ac + Bc  Imc/Ioc\nwhere:\n\n\nPc is the adjustment factor for the portion of the Contract Price payable in a specific currency \u201cc.\u201d\n\n\nAc and Bc are coefficients\n specified in the PCC, representing the nonadjustable and adjustable portions, respectively, of the Contract Price payable in that specific currency \u201cc;\u201d and\n\n\nImc is the index prevailing at the end of the month being invoiced and Ioc is the index prevailing 28 days before Bid opening for inputs payable; both in the specific currency \u201cc.\u201d\n\n43.2 If the value of the index is changed after it has been used in a calculation, the calculation shall be corrected and an adjustment made in the next payment certificate.  The index value shall be deemed to take account of all changes in cost due to fluctuations in costs.\n\n\t44. Retention\n\t44.1 The Procuring Entity shall retain from each payment due to the Contractor the proportion stated in the PCC until Completion of the whole of the Works.\n\n44.2 Upon the issue of a Certificate of Completion of the Works by the Project Manager, in accordance with GCC 51.1, half the total amount retained shall be repaid to the Contractor and half when the Defects Liability Period has passed and the Project Manager has certified that all Defects notified by the Project Manager to the Contractor before the end of this period have been corrected. The Contractor may substitute retention money with an \u201con demand\u201d Bank guarantee.\n\n\t45. Liquidated Damages\n\t45.1 The Contractor shall pay liquidated damages to the Procuring Entity at the rate per day stated in the PCC for each day that the Completion Date is later than the Intended Completion Date.  The total amount of liquidated damages shall not exceed the amount defined in the PCC.  The Procuring Entity may deduct liquidated damages from payments due to the Contractor.  Payment of liquidated damages shall not affect the Contractor\u2019s liabilities.\n\n45.2 If the Intended Completion Date is extended after liquidated damages have been paid, the Project Manager shall correct any overpayment of liquidated damages by the Contractor by adjusting the next payment certificate.  The Contractor shall be paid interest on the overpayment, calculated from the date of payment to the date of repayment, at the rates specified in GCC Sub-Clause 39.1.\n\n\t46.

The guarantee shall remain effective until the advance payment has been repaid, but the amount of the Guarantee shall be progressively reduced by the amounts repaid by the Contractor.  Interest shall not be charged on the advance payment\n47.3 The Contractor is to use the advance payment only to pay for Equipment, Plant, Materials, and mobilization expenses required specifically for execution of the Contract.  The Contractor shall demonstrate that advance payment has been used in this way by supplying copies of invoices or other documents to the Project Manager.\n\n47.4 The advance payment shall be repaid by deducting proportionate amounts from payments otherwise due to the Contractor, following the schedule of completed percentages of the Works on a payment basis.  No account shall be taken of the advance payment or its repayment in assessing valuations of work done, Variations, price adjustments, Compensation Events, Bonuses, or Liquidated Damages.\n\n\t48.

IT SBDs provide bidding and contracting models that facilitate successful installation, integration, and operation of a range of information technology applications \u2014 from straightforward supply and maintenance of technology products, to complex development, integration and operation of mission-critical information systems..\nWhen to Use this SBD\n\nThis SBD for Supply and Installation of Information Systems is recommended for single-stage procurement of supply and installation of information systems. It may also be used for the procurement of sophisticated or large-scale IT, possibly including communications technology and services, of systems engineering services, and of other IT goods/services for which the SBD for Goods or the Request for Proposal (RFP) approach would be unsuitable.\n\nSupply and Installation of Information Systems\n\nTwo key features distinguish supply & installation from goods procurements namely, increased supplier\u2019s risk and complex service requirements.  Together these two features significantly increase the complexity and risk of the procurement and require different evaluation and contracting terms.\n\nIn Supply & Installation procurement the Supplier assumes responsibility for the design, supply, and installation of a facility defined by the Procuring Entity mainly in terms of performance specifications.  Therefore, the Supplier\u2019s responsibility goes beyond the supply of whatever products or services the Procuring Entity requests, and extends to the provision of any other products or services required to make the facility perform to specifications.\n\nIS Supply and Installation procurement, therefore, requires a degree of professional judgment and expertise from suppliers that is commensurate with the higher degree of risk they are called to assume.  This frequently results in large and complex service components for this type of procurement.\n\nSingle-Stage Processing\n\nWhen bidding is based on technical product or service specifications, single-stage procurement is usually appropriate, even for complex procurements.  A good example would be the procurement of a large wide-area computing network with a variety of office support and application services, extensive operational acceptance testing requirements and centralized network management, where the basis for bidding is nevertheless a set of well-defined technical specifications and consequently the design risk is borne by the Procuring Entity.\n\nEven when functional or performance specifications are developed by the Procuring Entity, single-stage procurement is advisable if the specifications are likely to be met only by established products in the market.  In this case, Bidders have no real design discretion and Procuring Entities are not likely to benefit from technical solutions not already widely known.  For example, when procuring a complex application system, the Procuring Entity is likely to formulate its requirements through detailed functional specifications.  However, if these specifications can only be met by established software packages, the full potential benefit of two-stage procurement is not available.  In this case it might be better to use a single-stage process and a technical merit evaluation method that includes real product tests.\n\nComplex, single-stage procurements may emphasize extensive bidder conferencing and clarification processes based on written communications with full disclosure to all bidders of questions, answers and specification changes.  With the advent of electronic government procurement systems, the facilities for bidder conferencing, clarification, and resolution of issues raised about the adequacy or objectivity of specifications will become global, instant, and highly reliable.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Incoterms, this SBD does not support the option that bidders may offer previously imported Goods at CIP prices. The option was not included because the typical complexity and duration of Information System procurement combined with the fast pace of innovation in the field of IT make it unlikely that Goods already in Zambia at the time of bidding could still be up-to-date at the time of delivery.\n\nFurther, a margin of domestic preference cannot apply when the procurement includes major service requirements, a situation that is typical when procuring Information Systems. Therefore, this SBD does not support domestic preference. If an IT procurement mostly comprises quickly procurable Goods for which it makes sense to consider already imported Goods and/or for which the Procuring Entity wishes to apply domestic preference, the harmonized SBD for Goods could be considered as an alternative that supports both CIP pricing of already imported Goods and domestic preference.\n\nLastly, this SBD does not support DDP terms and pricing pursuant to the above reasoning. While procurement of Information Systems often has the character of single-responsibility contracting, Goods and Services are usually specified in detail and well separated from each other, as is conducive for CIP and EXW pricing. Nevertheless, if requesting bid prices and contracting on the basis of DDP would make sense for a particular procurement, this SBD would need to be modified ad-hoc. Clauses in need of modification include the Bid Pricing clause of ITB, the evaluation of the bid price in BDS, and the clauses for Taxes and Duties as well as for Procurement, Delivery and Transport in GCC. The related provisions in the SBD for the Supply and Installation of Plant and Equipment, Turnkey Contracting, could be used as guidance.  In fact, using the latter SBD in a genuine turnkey situation may well be an acceptable alternative to be considered.\n\nProcess for Feedback and Discussion of IT Procurement Issues\n\nZPPA welcomes feedback on this Standard Bidding Document, particularly from people who have used it in actual procurement transactions. Those wishing to submit comments or questions on these Bidding Documents, please address your comments to:\n\nThe Director General\n\nZambia Public Procurement Authority\n\nRed Cross House, P.O. Box 31009\n\nPlot 2837, Los Angeles Boulevard\n\nLongacres, Lusaka\n\nZAMBIA\nhttp://www.ppa.org.zm\n\nInstructions to Customize the Bidding Document for a Specific Procurement\n\n\nAs shown in the table below, this SBD contains two types of documents:  those which must be used unchanged and those that should be customized specifically for each procurement. This version can be used to customize the Invitation for Bids and Sections II, V, VI, and VII, to meet the requirements of the specific procurement.  Sections I and IV, however, must be incorporated unchanged in the Bidding Documents, and Section III should only be completed and edited to the extent indicated there.\n\n\tTo be customized\n\tTo be used unchanged\n\n\t\nInvitation for Bids\n\nSection II\nBid Data Sheet\n\nSection V\nSpecial Conditions of Contract\n\nSection VI\nTechnical Requirements (including Implementation Schedule)\n\nSection VII\nSample Forms (including the Contract Agreement)\n\tSection I\nInstructions to Bidders\n\nSection III\nEligible Countries for the Provision of Goods, Works, and Services in Zambia (to be completed and edited only)\nSection IV\nGeneral Conditions of Contract\n\n\n\nThe specific details of the Instructions to Bidders must be included in the Bid Data Sheet only.  Amendments to the General Conditions of Contract must be made through the Special Conditions of Contract.  The Technical Requirements Section should not be used to modify any of the subjects covered by Sections I, III, or IV.\n\n\nClauses included in Section V, Special Conditions of Contract, are illustrative and should be modified as appropriate to reflect the specific needs of each procurement.  Because such modifications prevail over the General Conditions of Contract, substantial changes should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. If, in the opinion of the Procuring Entity, the specific nature of a procurement justifies a substantial change, ZPPA should be consulted.\nSome of the language presented in Section VI, Technical Requirements, as well as certain Sample Forms (so identified), are also illustrative.  Appropriate modifications should be made to match the requirements of each particular procurement.\n\n\nThe following typographical conventions are used in this SBD:\n\n\t\u00b7 Standard SBD text is presented in a typeface such as used in this line (serif roman typeface).\n\n\t\u00b7 Explanatory text and notes are presented in a typeface such as that used in this line and in the body of this Preface (sans serif typeface).\n\n\t\u00b7 When parameters, options, instructions to prepare the Bidding Document, or explanatory notes appear directly within the standard text, they are enclosed with square brackets, italicized, and the key parameter bolded.  For example:\n\n\t\u201cThe Warranty Period is [36] months from the date of the Operational Acceptance of the System.\u201d\n\n\t\u00b7 When options appear within the text, they are enclosed within square brackets and separated by the slash character \u201c/\u201d.  For example:\n\n\t\u201cThe bid evaluation [will] take into account technical factors in addition to cost factors.\u201d\n\n\t\u00b7 Otherwise, italic typeface is used to indicate guidance in selecting a word or clause which then follows in bolded italic typeface as a parameter or option, or follows enclosed in double quotation marks if suggested verbatim as \u201cfully formulated text.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll explanatory text (i.e., all text in sans serif typeface) must be removed from the final Bidding Document.  Also, all bracketed text must be either removed, if not relevant to the specific procurement, or selected for inclusion in the final Bidding Document.  Where options are presented, one must be selected and the final chosen text should be presented in standard roman typeface.  Such text, if in bold italic typeface, could simply be highlighted, un-bolded, the italics switched off, and any starting and ending quotation marks removed.\n\n\nFootnotes that provide guidance and instruction to the Procuring Entity in preparing the Bidding Document should also be removed from the final draft.  However, some Sample Forms contain footnotes that provide instructions to bidders on how the form should be prepared.  These should remain in the final Bidding Document.\n\n\nThe cover page of this SBD and, of course, the Preface (i.e., this section) must be removed.  The sample cover page following the Preface may be filled with the appropriate details for the procurement and thus become the cover page of the actual Bidding Document.\n\nBIDDING DOCUMENT (SINGLE-STAGE)\n\nIssued on:  [May, 2022]\n[TENDER FOR THE SUPPLY, DELIVERY, INSTALLATION AND COMMISSIONING OF CIRCUIT SWITCHED CORE NETWORK & INTERNATIONAL GATEWAY (CS CORE & IGW)] \nIFB No:  [ZT/TD/T/0005/2022]\nProject/Programme:  [SUPPLY, DELIVERY, INSTALLATION AND COMMISSIONING OF CIRCUIT SWITCHED CORE NETWORK & INTERNATIONAL GATEWAY (CS CORE & IGW)]\nProcuring Entity:  [Zamtel]\nNote:\nThis is a sample cover page for the actual Bidding Document.

It is critical that the content of the Invitation for Bids be and remain consistent with the BDS.  In particular, the dates, times, and place for bid submission and opening, and any requirement for securing the bid (and in case of Bid Security, its minimum percentage or amount), in the IFB must be carefully checked to ensure consistency with the BDS.  Also, the IFB should list all the qualification criteria required for prospective Bidders to be responsive, as officially specified in the BDS (e.g., minimum financial capacity, the minimum number of other Information Systems installations previously carried out with substantially similar characteristics).\n\nInvitation for Bids (IFB)\n\n[20th May, 2022] \nZambia\n[Supply, Delivery, Installation and Commissioning of Circuit Switched Core Network & International Gateway (CS Core & IGW)]\n[Brief Description of the Information System]\n [Tender for the Supply, Delivery, Installation and Commissioning of Circuit Switched Core Network & International Gateway (CS Core & IGW)] \n\n[ZT/TD/T/0005/2022]\n2.\nZamtel has set aside budget toward the procurement of Supply, Delivery, Installation and Commissioning of Circuit Switched Core Network & International Gateway (CS Core & IGW), and it intends to apply part of the proceeds to payments under the agreement(s) resulting from this Tender number ZT/TD/T/0005/2022.\n3.\nZamtel serves as the implementing agency for the projects and now invites bids from the following shortlisted Suppliers:\n\ni.

General\n\n\t1.\nScope of Bid and Bidding Process\n\t1.1\nThe Procuring Entity named in the BDS and the SCC for GCC Clause 1.1\u00a0(b)\u00a0(i), or its duly authorized Purchasing Agent if so specified in the BDS (interchangeably referred to as \u201cthe Procuring Entity\u201d in these Bidding Documents), invites bids for the supply and installation of the Information System (IS), as briefly described in the BDS and specified in greater detail in these Bidding Documents.\n\n\t\n\t1.2\nThe title and identification number of the Invitation for Bids (IFB) and resulting Contract(s) are provided in the BDS.\n1.3\nThroughout the Bidding Documents, the term \"in writing\" means communicated in written form (e.g. by mail, e-mail, fax, telex) with proof of receipt, and the term \"days\" means calendar days unless a different meaning is evident from the context.\n\n1.4\nIf the BDS so provides, alternative procedures forming part or all of what is commonly known as e-Tendering are available to the extent specified in, or referred to by, the BDS.\n\n\t2.\nSource of Funds\n\t2.1\nThe Procuring Entity named in the BDS has applied for or received funds - equivalent to the amount indicated in the BDS toward the cost of the Project specified in the BDS.  The Procuring Entity intends to apply a portion of the proceeds to eligible payments under the Contract for which these Bidding Documents are issued.\n\n\t\n\t2.2\nPayment by the Procuring Entity will be made only at the request of the Procuring Entity\u2019s executing agency. The Government prohibits a withdrawal from the funds for the purpose of any payment to persons or entities, or for any import of goods, if such payment or import, is prohibited by a decision of the United Nations Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.  \n\n\t3.\nFraud and Corruption\n\t3.1\nIt is the Government\u2019s policy to require that Procuring Entity (including beneficiaries of the funds), as well as bidders, suppliers, and contractors and their subcontractors under Government-financed contracts, observe the highest standard of ethics during the procurement and execution of such contracts.\n In pursuance of this policy, the Government:\n\n(a)\ndefines, for the purposes of this provision, the terms set forth below as follows:\n\n(i)\n\u201ccorrupt practice\u201d\n is the offering, giving, receiving or soliciting, directly or indirectly, of anything of value to influence improperly the actions of another party;\n\n(ii) \n\u201cfraudulent practice\u201d\n is any act or omission, including a misrepresentation, that knowingly or recklessly misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party to obtain a financial or other benefit or to avoid an obligation;\n\n(iii)\n\u201ccollusive practice\u201d\n is an arrangement between two or more parties designed to achieve an improper purpose, including to influence improperly the actions of another party;\n\n(iv)\n\u201ccoercive practice\u201d\n is impairing or harming, or threatening to impair or harm, directly or indirectly, any party or the property of the party to influence improperly the actions of a party;\n\n(v)\n\u201cobstructive practice\u201d is\n\n(aa)\ndeliberately destroying, falsifying, altering or concealing of evidence material to the investigation or making false statements to investigators in order to materially impede a Government investigation into allegations of a corrupt, fraudulent, coercive or collusive practice; and/or threatening, harassing or intimidating any party to prevent it from disclosing its knowledge of matters relevant to the investigation or from pursuing the investigation; or\n(bb)\nacts intended to materially impede the exercise of the Government\u2019s inspection and audit rights provided for under sub-clause 3.1 (e) below.\n(b)\nwill reject a proposal for award if it determines that the bidder recommended for award has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in competing for the contract in question;\n\n(c)\nwill cancel the portion of the funds allocated to a contract if it determines at any time that representatives of the Procuring Entity or of a beneficiary engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices during the procurement or the execution of that contract, without the Procuring Entity having taken timely and appropriate action satisfactory to the Government to address such practices when they occur;\n\n(d)\nwill sanction a firm or individual, including suspending or barring a bidder or supplier in accordance with Sections sixty-five, sixty-six and sixty-seven of the Public Procurement Act of 2008 and regulations 162 to 167 of the Public Procurement Regulations of 2011. A bidder or supplier aggrieved by such a decision, may appeal in accordance with Section sixty-nine of the Public Procurement Act of 2008; and\n\n(e)\nwill have the right to require that a provision be included in bidding documents and in contracts financed by Government, requiring bidders, suppliers, and contractors and their sub-contractors to permit the Government to inspect their accounts and records and other documents relating to the bid submission and contract performance and to have them audited by auditors appointed by the Government.\n\n\t\n\t3.2\nFurthermore, Bidders shall be aware of the provision stated in Clause\u00a09.8 and Clause\u00a041.2 of the General Conditions of Contract.\n\n\t\n\t3.3\nAny communications between the Bidder and the Procuring Entity related to matters of alleged fraud or corruption must be made in writing.\n\n\t\n\t3.4\nBy signing the Bid Submission Form, the Bidder represents that it either is the owner of the Intellectual Property Rights in the hardware, software or materials offered, or that it has proper authorization and/or license to offer them from the owner of such rights.  For the purpose of this Clause, Intellectual Property Rights shall be as defined in GCC Clause\u00a01.1\u00a0(c)\u00a0(xvii).  Willful misrepresentation of these facts shall be considered a fraudulent practice subject to the provisions of Clauses 3.1 through 3.4 above, without prejudice of other remedies that the Procuring Entity may take.\n\n\t4.\nEligible Bidders\n\t4.1\nA Bidder, and all parties constituting the Bidder, may have the nationality of any country, subject to the restrictions specified in Section III, Eligible Countries.  A Bidder shall be deemed to have the nationality of a country if the Bidder is a citizen or is constituted, incorporated, or registered and operates in conformity with the provisions of the laws of that country. \n\n\t\n\t4.2\nIf a prequalification process has been undertaken for the Contract(s) for which these Bidding Documents have been issued, only those Bidders may participate that had been prequalified and continue to meet the eligibility criteria of this Clause.  A prequalified Joint Venture may not change partners or its structure when submitting a bid. \n\n\t\n\t4.3\nA firm may be excluded from bidding if:\n\n(a)\nit was engaged by the Procuring Entity to provide consulting services for the preparation of the design, specifications, or other documents to be used for the procurement of the Information System described in these Bidding Documents; or\n\n(b)\nIt is a government-owned enterprise in the Procuring Entity\u2019s country, unless it can establish that it meets the provisions of Section 34 of the Public Procurement Act of 2008. To establish eligibility, the government-owned enterprise or institution should provide all relevant documents (including its charter) sufficient to demonstrate that it meets the provisions of Section 34(2) of the Public Procurement Act of 2008.\n\n\t\n\t4.4\nA firm that has been determined to be ineligible by ZPPA in in accordance with Sections sixty-five, sixty-six and sixty-seven of the Public Procurement Act of 2008 and in accordance with regulations 162 to 167 of the Public Procurement Regulations of 2011 shall be not be eligible to be awarded a contract.\n\n\t\n\t4.5\nA firm or individual is or will be disqualified from participation in this bidding if, at any time from advertisement of the bidding until and including contract award, the firm or individual is under:\n\n(a)\na suspension by ZPPA as a result of execution of a Bid-Securing Declaration pursuant to ITB Clause\u00a017.6 in another Government-financed procurement, or under a suspension by the Procuring Entity for other reasons that have been agreed by ZPPA; or\n\n(b)\nA declaration of ineligibility by ZPPA in accordance with ITB Clause 3.1\u00a0(d).  The list of individuals and firms debarred from participating in Government-financed projects or programmes is available at http://www.ppa.org.zm, or\n\n(c)\nA sanction imposed by the United Nations Security Council, as mentioned in ITB Clause 2.2.\n\n\t\n\t4.6\nA firm or other entity that is ineligible according to any of the above provisions of this Clause, may also not participate as a Joint Venture partner, or as Subcontractor for or supplier of goods, works or services.  If a bid becomes materially incomplete after removing ineligible entities, the bid may be disqualified.\n\n\t\n\t4.7\nBidders shall provide such evidence of their continued eligibility satisfactory to the Procuring Entity, as the Procuring Entity shall reasonably request.\n\n\t5.\nEligible Goods and Services\n\t5.1\nFor the purposes of these Bidding Documents, the Information System means all:\n\n(a) \nthe required information technologies, including all information processing and communications-related hardware, software, supplies, and consumable items that the Supplier is required to supply and install under the Contract, plus all associated documentation, and all other materials and goods to be supplied, installed, integrated, and made operational (collectively called \u201cthe Goods\u201d in some clauses of the ITB); and \n\n(b) \nthe related software development, transportation, insurance, installation, customization, integration, commissioning, training, technical support, maintenance, repair, and other services necessary for proper operation of the Information System to be provided by the selected Bidder and as specified in the Contract.\n\n\t\n\t5.2\nFunds from Government are disbursed only for expenditures for an Information System made up of goods and services provided by nationals of, and produced in or supplied from, eligible source countries as defined in Section III, Eligible Countries.  An Information System is deemed to be produced in a certain country when, in the territory of that country, through software development, manufacturing, or substantial and major assembly or integration of components, a commercially recognized product results that is substantially different in basic characteristics or in purpose or utility from its components.\n\n5.3\nFor purposes of this clause, the nationality of the Bidder is distinct from the country in which the Information System and its goods components are produced or from which the related services are supplied.\n\n\t6.\nQualifications of the Bidder\n\t6.1\nBy submission of documentary evidence in its bid, the Bidder must establish to the Procuring Entity\u2019s satisfaction:\n\n\t\n\t(a)\nthat it has the financial, technical, and production capability necessary to perform the Contract, meets the qualification criteria specified in the BDS, and has a successful performance history.  If a prequalification process has been undertaken for the Contract(s) for which these Bidding Documents have been issued, the Bidder shall, as part of its bid, update any information submitted with its application for prequalification;\n\n(For the purposes of establishing a Bidder\u2019s qualifications, and unless stated to the contrary in the BDS, the experience and / or resources of any Subcontractor will not contribute to the Bidder\u2019s qualifications; only those of a Joint Venture partner will be considered.)\n\n\t\n\t(b)\nthat, in the case of a Bidder offering to supply key goods components of the Information System, as identified in the BDS, that the Bidder does not itself produce, the Bidder is duly authorized by the producer to supply those components in the Procuring Entity\u2019s country under the Contract(s) that may result from this bidding; (This will be accomplished by including Manufacturer\u2019s Authorizations in the bid, based on the sample found in Section VII.)\n\n\t\n\t(c)\nthat, if a Bidder proposes Subcontractors for key services if and as identified in the BDS, these Subcontractors have agreed in writing to serve for the Bidder under the Contract(s) that may result from this bidding; and\n\n\t\n\t(d)\nthat, in the case of a Bidder not doing business within the Procuring Entity\u2019s country, the Bidder is or will be (if awarded the Contract) represented by an Agent in that country who is equipped and able to carry out the Bidder\u2019s maintenance, technical support, training, and repair obligations prescribed in the General and Special Conditions of Contract, and/or Technical Requirements.\n\n\t\n\t6.2\nBids submitted by a Joint Venture of two or more firms as partners shall also comply with the following requirements:\n\n(a)\nthe bid shall be signed so as to be legally binding on all partners;\n\n(b)\none of the partners shall be nominated as being in charge, and this nomination shall be evidenced by submitting a power of attorney signed by legally authorized signatories of all the partners;\n\n(c)\nthe partner in charge shall be authorized to incur liabilities and receive instructions for and on behalf of any and all partners of the Joint Venture, and the entire execution of the Contract, including payment, shall be done exclusively with the partner in charge;\n\n(d)\nthe partner or combination of partners that is responsible for a specific component of the Information System must meet the relevant minimum qualification criteria for that component;\n\n(e)\na firm may submit bids either as a single Bidder on its own, or as partner in one, and only one, Joint Venture.  If, as a result of the bid opening pursuant to ITB Clause 24, this requirement is not met, all bids involving the firm as a single Bidder or Joint Venture partner will be disqualified;\n\n\t\n\t(f)\nall partners of the Joint Venture shall be liable jointly and severally for the execution of the Contract in accordance with the Contract terms, and a statement to this effect shall be included in the authorization mentioned under ITB Clause\u00a06.2 (b) above, in the bid as well as in the Contract (in case of a successful bid).\n\n\t\n\t6.3\nIf a Bidder intends to subcontract major items of supply or services, it shall include in the bid details of the name and nationality of the proposed Subcontractor for each of those items and shall be responsible for ensuring that any Subcontractor proposed complies with the requirements of ITB Clause 4, and that any Goods or Services components of the Information System to be provided by the Subcontractor comply with the requirements of ITB Clause 5 and the related evidence required by ITB Clause\u00a013.1 (e) (iii) is submitted.  Bidders are free to list more than one Subcontractor against each item.  Quoted rates and prices will be deemed to apply, whichever Subcontractor is appointed, and no adjustment of the rates or prices will be permitted.  The Procuring Entity reserves the right to delete any proposed Subcontractor from the list.  This shall be done prior to Contract signature, by deleting such unacceptable Subcontractors from Appendix 3 to the Contract Agreement, which shall list the approved Subcontractors for each item prior to Contract signature.  Subsequent additions and deletions from the list of approved Subcontractors shall be performed in accordance with GCC Clause\u00a020 (as revised in the SCC, if applicable) and Appendix\u00a03 to the Contract Agreement.\n\n\nFor the purposes of these Bidding Documents, a Subcontractor is any vendor or service provider with whom the Bidder contracts for the supply or execution of any part of the Information System to be provided by the Bidder under the Contract (such as the supply of major hardware, software, or other components of the required Information Technologies specified, or the performance of related Services, e.g., software development, transportation, installation, customization, integration, commissioning, training, technical support, maintenance, repair, etc.).\n\n6.4\nA firm which is a Bidder, whether as a single Bidder or as a partner in a Joint Venture, cannot be a Subcontractor in other bids, except for the supply of commercially available hardware or software by the firm, as well as purely incidental services such as installation/configuration, routine training, and ongoing maintenance/support.  If the BDS for ITB Clause 6.1\u00a0(a) allows the qualification of Subcontractors nominated for certain components to be taken into account in assessing the Bidder\u2019s overall qualifications, any Subcontractor so nominated by any Bidder is automatically disqualified from being a Bidder itself or a partner in a Joint Venture.  The same will normally apply to firms that have provided Subcontractor agreements for certain services pursuant to ITB Clause 6.1\u00a0(c).  Non-compliance may result in the rejection of all bids in which the affected firm participates as Bidder or as partner in a Joint Venture.  As long as in compliance with these provisions, or as long as unaffected by them due to not participating as Bidder or as partner in a Joint Venture, a firm may be proposed as a Subcontractor in any number of bids.  If the BDS for ITB 28.1 permits the submission of bids for Subsystems, lots, or slices, then the provisions of this Clause 6.4 apply only to bids for the same Subsystem(s), lot(s), or slice(s);\n\n\t7.\nCost of Bidding\n\t7.1\nThe Bidder shall bear all costs associated with the preparation and submission of its bid, and the Procuring Entity will in no case be responsible or liable for those costs.\n\n\t8.\nSite Visit\n\t8.1\nThe Bidder may wish to visit and examine the site or sites of the Information System and obtain for itself, at its own responsibility and risk, all information that may be necessary for preparing the bid and entering into the Contract.  The costs of visiting the site or sites shall be at the Bidder\u2019s own expense.\n\n\t\n\t8.2\nThe Procuring Entity will arrange for the Bidder and any of its personnel or agents to gain access to the relevant site or sites, provided that the Bidder gives the Procuring Entity adequate notice of a proposed visit of at least fourteen (14) days.  Alternatively, the Procuring Entity may organize a site visit or visits concurrently with the pre-bid meeting, as specified in the BDS for ITB Clause 10.2.  Failure of a Bidder to make a site visit will not be a cause for its disqualification.\n\n8.3\nNo site visits shall be arranged or scheduled after the deadline for the submission of the Bids and prior to the award of Contract.\n\n\nB.  The Bidding Documents\n\n\t9.\nContent of Bidding Documents\n\t9.1\nThe contents of the Bidding Documents are listed below and should be read in conjunction with any addenda issued in accordance with ITB Clause 11:\n\n\t\n\tSection I \nInstructions to Bidders (ITB)\n\nSection II \nBid Data Sheet (BDS)\n\nSection III\nEligible Countries for the Provision of Goods, Works, and Services in  Zambia \n\nSection IV\nGeneral Conditions of Contract (GCC)\n\nSection V\nSpecial Conditions of Contract (SCC)\n\nSection VI\nTechnical Requirements (including Implementation Schedule)\n\nSection VII\nSample Forms\n\n9.2\nBidders are expected to examine all instructions, forms, terms, specifications, and other information in the Bidding Documents.  Failure to furnish all information required by the Bidding Documents or to submit a bid not substantially responsive to the Bidding Documents in every respect will be at the Bidder\u2019s risk and may result in the rejection of its bid.\n\n\t\n\t9.3\nThe Invitation for Bids is not formally part of the Bidding Documents and is included for reference only.  In case of inconsistencies, the actual Bidding Documents shall prevail.\n\n\t10.\nClarification of Bidding Documents and Pre-bid Meeting\n\t10.1\nA prospective Bidder requiring any clarification of the Bidding Documents may notify the Procuring Entity in writing at the Procuring Entity\u2019s address and by one of the means indicated in the BDS.  Similarly, if a Bidder feels that any important provision in the documents will be unacceptable, such an issue should be raised as soon as possible.  The Procuring Entity will respond in writing to any request for clarification or modification of the Bidding Documents that it receives no later than twenty-one (21) days prior to the deadline for submission of bids prescribed by the Procuring Entity. Copies of the Procuring Entity\u2019s response (including an explanation of the query but not identifying its source) will be sent to all prospective Bidders that received the Bidding Documents from the Procuring Entity.\n\n\t\n\t10.2\nWhen specified in the BDS, the Procuring Entity will organize and Bidders are welcome to attend a pre-bid meeting at the time and place indicated in the BDS.  The purpose of the meeting will be to clarify issues and answer questions on any matter that may be raised at this stage, with particular attention to issues related to the Technical Requirements.  Bidders are requested to submit any questions in writing to reach the Procuring Entity not later than one week before the meeting.  Questions and answers will be transmitted in accordance with ITB Clause\u00a010.1.  Minutes of the meeting, including the questions raised and responses given, together with any responses prepared after the meeting, will be transmitted without delay to all those that received the Bidding Documents from the Procuring Entity.  Any modification to the Bidding Documents listed in ITB Clause\u00a09.1, which may become necessary as a result of the pre-bid meeting, shall be made by the Procuring Entity exclusively by issuing an Addendum pursuant to ITB Clause 11 and not through the minutes of the pre-bid meeting.\n\n\t11.\nAmendment of Bidding Documents\n\t11.1\nAt any time prior to the deadline for submission of bids, the Procuring Entity may, for any reason, whether at its own initiative or in response to a clarification requested by a prospective Bidder, amend the Bidding Documents.  Later amendments on the same subject modify or replace earlier ones.\n\n\t\n\t11.2\nAmendments will be provided in the form of Addenda to the Bidding Documents, which will be sent in writing to all prospective Bidders that received the Bidding Documents from the Procuring Entity.  Addenda will be binding on Bidders.  Bidders are required to immediately acknowledge receipt of any such Addenda.  It will be assumed that the amendments contained in such Addenda will have been taken into account by the Bidder in its bid.\n\n\t\n\t11.3\nIn order to afford prospective Bidders reasonable time in which to take the amendment into account in preparing their bids, the Procuring Entity may, at its discretion, extend the deadline for the submission of bids, in which case, the Procuring Entity will notify all Bidders in writing of the extended deadline.\n\n\nC.

Except where explicitly prohibited in the BDS for specific items or standards, the Bidder may substitute alternative brand/model names or standards in its bid, provided that it demonstrates to the Procuring Entity\u2019s satisfaction that the use of the substitute(s) will result in the Information System being able to perform substantially equivalent to or better than that specified in the Technical Requirements.\n\n\t17.\nSecuring the Bid\n\t17.1\nThe BDS for this Clause specifies whether bids must be secured, and if so, whether by a Bid-Securing Declaration or by a Bid Security.  If a Bid Security is required or optional, the BDS also specifies the amount.\n\n\t\n\t17.2\nSecuring the bids shall be substantially in accordance with the related sample forms included in Section VII or other forms approved by the Procuring Entity prior to bid submission.  Bids must remain secured for a period of 28 days beyond the validity period of the bids, as extended, if applicable, in accordance with ITB Clause 18.2.

Sanctions due to a breach of the terms of a Bid-Securing Declaration pursuant to ITB Clause 17.6 will apply to all partners to the Joint Venture.\n\n\t\n\t17.4\nIf a Bid-Securing Declaration or Bid Security is required in accordance with ITB Clause 17.1, any bid not accompanied by a substantially acceptable Bid-Securing Declaration or Bid Security in accordance with ITB Clauses 17.2 and 17.3, shall be rejected by the Procuring Entity as non-responsive.\n\n\t\n\t17.5\nUnless executed or forfeited pursuant to ITB Clause 17.6, Bid-Securing Declarations, if any, will expire for, or Bid Securities, if any, will be returned as promptly as possible to,\n\n(a)\nall Bidders upon annulment of the bidding pursuant to ITB Clause 34;\n\n(b)\nBidders refusing a request to extend the period of  validity of their bids pursuant to ITB Clause 18.2;\n\n(c)\nthe successful Bidder once it has signed the Contract Agreement and furnished a valid Performance Security as required;\n\n(d)\nthe unsuccessful Bidders at the same time as in (c), that is, when they are informed about the successful establishment of the contract with the successful Bidder.\n\n\t\n\t17.6\nThe Bid-Securing Declaration, if any, may be executed, or the Bid Security, if any, may be forfeited:\n\n(a)\nif a Bidder withdraws its bid during the period of bid validity specified by the Bidder on the Bid Submission Form or any extension of validity the Bidder has agreed to pursuant to ITB Clause 18.2; or\n\n(b)\nin the case of the successful Bidder, if the Bidder fails to:\n\n(i)\nsign the Contract Agreement in accordance with ITB Clause 36; or\n\n(ii)\nfurnish the Performance Security in accordance with ITB Clause 37.\n\n\t\n\t17.7\nIf a bid security is not required in the BDS, and\n\n(a) if a Bidder withdraws its bid during the period of bid validity specified by the Bidder on the Letter of Bid Form, except as provided in ITB 18.2, or\n\n(b) if the successful Bidder fails to: sign the Contract in accordance with ITB 36; or furnish a performance security in accordance with ITB 37;\n\nthe Procuring Entity may, if provided for in the BDS, declare the Bidder disqualified to be awarded a contract by the Employer for a period of time as stated in the BDS.\n\n\t18.\nPeriod of Validity of Bids\n\t18.1\nBids shall remain valid, at a minimum, for the period specified in the BDS after the deadline date for bid submission prescribed by the Procuring Entity, pursuant to ITB Clause 21.  A bid valid for a shorter period shall be rejected by the Procuring Entity as non-responsive.  For the convenience of Bidders, the BDS spells out the minimal original expiration dates for the validity of the bid and, if applicable pursuant to ITB Clause 17.1, for securing the bid. \u00a0However, Bidders are responsible for adjusting the dates in the BDS in accordance with any extensions to the deadline date of bid submission pursuant to ITB Clause 21.2. \n\n\t\n\t18.2\nIn exceptional circumstances, prior to expiry of the bid validity period, the Procuring Entity may request that the Bidders extend the period of validity for a specified additional period. \u00a0The request and the responses to the request shall be made in writing. A Bidder may refuse the request without risking execution of the Bid-Securing Declaration or forfeiting the Bid Security, but in this case the bid will be out of the competition for the award. Except as provided in ITB Clause\u00a018.3, a Bidder agreeing to the request will not be required or permitted to modify its bid, but will be required to ensure that the bid remains secured for a correspondingly longer period, pursuant to ITB Clause 17.2.\n\n18.3\nIn the case of fixed price contracts, if the award is delayed by a period exceeding fifty-six (56) days beyond the expiry of the initial bid validity, the contract price will be adjusted as specified in the request for extension.  Bid evaluation will be based on the bid prices without taking into consideration the above correction.\n\n\t19.\nFormat and Signing of Bid\n\t19.1\nThe Bidder shall prepare an original and the number of copies/sets of the bid specified in the BDS, clearly marking each one as \u201cOriginal Bid,\u201d \u201cCopy No.\u00a01,\u201d \u201cCopy No.\u00a02,\u201d etc., as appropriate.

If the outer envelope discloses the Bidder\u2019s identity, the Procuring Entity will not guarantee the anonymity of the bid submission, but this disclosure will not constitute grounds for bid rejection.\n\n\t21.\nDeadline for Submission of Bids\n\t21.1\nBids must be received by the Procuring Entity at the address specified in the BDS for ITB Clause 20.2 no later than the time and date stated in the BDS.\n\n\t\n\t21.2\nThe Procuring Entity may, at its discretion, extend this deadline for submission of bids by amending the Bidding Documents in accordance with ITB Clause 11.3, in which case all rights and obligations of the Procuring Entity and Bidders will thereafter be subject to the deadline as extended.\n\n\t22.\nLate Bids\n\t22.1\nAny bid received by the Procuring Entity after the bid submission deadline prescribed by the Procuring Entity in the BDS for ITB Clause 21, will be rejected and returned unopened to the Bidder.\n\n\t23.\nWithdrawal, Substitution, and Modification of Bids\n\t23.1\nThe Bidder may withdraw, substitute, or modify its bid after submission, provided that written notice of the withdrawal, substitution, or modification is received by the Procuring Entity prior to the deadline prescribed for bid submission. All notices must be duly signed by an authorized representative and shall include a copy of the authorization (the power of attorney) in accordance with ITB Sub-Clause 19.2. \n\n\t\n\t23.2 All notices of withdrawal, substitution, or modification shall\n(a)\nbe addressed to the Procuring Entity at the address named in the BDS for ITB Clause 20.2\u00a0(a), and\n\n(b)\nbear the Contract name, the IFB Title and IFB Number, and the words \u201cBid Withdrawal Notice\u201d, Bid Substitution Notice\u201d, or \u201cBid Modification Notice\u201d.  \n23.3 A notice may also be sent by electronic means such as fax or e-mail, but in this case must include a scan of the mailing receipt showing both the sender's and receiver's addresses for the signed hardcopy of the notice, and a scan of the power of attorney.\n\n23.4 Bids requested to be withdrawn in accordance with ITB 23.1 shall be returned unopened to the Bidders.

Withdrawal of a bid during this interval may result in the execution of the Bid-Securing Declaration, if any, or forfeiture of the Bid Security, if any, pursuant to ITB Clause 17.6.\n\n\nE.  Bid Opening and Evaluation\n\n\t24.\nOpening of Bids by Procuring Entity\n\t24.1\nThe Procuring Entity will open all bids, including withdrawals, substitutions, and modifications, in public, in the presence of Bidders\u2019 representatives who choose to attend, at the time, on the date and at the place specified in the BDS.  Bidders\u2019 representatives shall sign a register as proof of their attendance.\n\n\t\n\t24.2\nFirst, envelopes marked \u201cBid Withdrawal Notice\u201d shall be opened and read out and the envelope with the corresponding bid shall not be opened, but returned to the Bidder.  No bid withdrawal shall be permitted unless the corresponding withdrawal notice contains a valid authorization to request the withdrawal and is read out at bid opening.  Next, envelopes marked \u201cBid Substitution Notice\u201d shall be opened and read out and exchanged with the corresponding bid being substituted, and the substituted bid shall not be opened, but returned to the Bidder. No bid substitution shall be permitted unless the corresponding substitution notice contains a valid authorization to request the substitution and is read out at bid opening. Envelopes marked \u201cBid Modification Notice\u201d shall be opened and read out with the corresponding bid. No bid modification shall be permitted unless the corresponding modification notice contains a valid authorization to request the modification and is read out at bid opening. Only bids that are opened and read out at bid opening shall be considered further.\n24.3\nBids shall be opened one at a time, reading out:  the name of the Bidder and whether there is a modification; the total bid price including any unconditional discounts, and, if applicable, the prices and unconditional discounts for Subsystems, lots, or slices; the presence or absence of a Bid-Securing Declaration or a Bid Security if one was required; any conditional discounts offered for the award of more than one Subsystem, lot, or slice, if the BDS for ITB Clause 28.1 permits such discounts to be considered in the bid evaluation; and any other such details as the Procuring Entity may consider appropriate. \n\n24.4\nBids and modifications that are not opened and read out at bid opening shall not be considered for further evaluation, irrespective of the circumstances.  These bids, including any bids validly withdrawn in accordance with ITB Clause 24.2, will promptly be returned, unopened, to their Bidders.\n\n24.5\nThe Procuring Entity will prepare minutes of the bid opening, including the information disclosed to those present in accordance with ITB Clause\u00a024.3. The minutes will promptly be distributed to all Bidders that met the deadline for submitting bids.\n\n\t25.\nClarification of Bids\n\t25.1\nDuring the bid evaluation, the Procuring Entity may, at its discretion, ask the Bidder for a clarification of its bid.  The request for clarification and the response shall be in writing, and no change in the price or substance of the bid shall be sought, offered, or permitted.\n\n\t26.\nPreliminary Examination of Bids\n\t26.1\nThe Procuring Entity will examine the bids to determine whether they are complete, whether any computational errors have been made, whether required sureties have been furnished, whether the documents have been properly signed, and whether the bids are generally in order.  In the case where a prequalification process has been undertaken for the Contract(s) for which these Bidding Documents have been issued, the Procuring Entity will ensure that each bid is from a prequalified Bidder, and in the case of a Joint Venture, that partners and structure of the Joint Venture are unchanged from those in the prequalification.\n\n\t\n\t26.2\nArithmetical errors will be rectified on the following basis. \u00a0If there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total price, which is obtained by multiplying the unit price and quantity, or between added or subtracted subtotals and totals, the unit or subtotal price shall prevail and the total price shall be corrected, unless in the opinion of the Procuring Entity there is an obvious misplacement of the decimal point in the unit or subtotal prices, in which case the line item total  as quoted shall govern and the unit price or sub-total shall be corrected. \u00a0If there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words will prevail, unless the discrepancy is the result of a typo/error for which the correction is self-evident to the Procuring Entity. \u00a0If the Bidder with the Lowest Evaluated Bid does not accept the correction of errors, the bid shall be rejected.\n\n26.3\nThe Procuring Entity may waive any minor informality, nonconformity, or irregularity in a bid that does not constitute a material deviation, provided such waiver does not prejudice or affect the relative ranking of any Bidder.\n\n26.4\nPrior to the detailed evaluation, the Procuring Entity will determine whether each bid is of acceptable quality, is complete, and is substantially responsive to the Bidding Documents.  For purposes of this determination, a substantially responsive bid is one that conforms to all the terms, conditions, and specifications of the Bidding Documents without material deviations, exceptions, objections, conditionalities, or reservations.  A material deviation, exception, objection, conditionality, or reservation is one: (i)\u00a0that limits in any substantial way the scope, quality, or performance of the Information System; or (ii)\u00a0that limits, in any substantial way that is inconsistent with the Bidding Documents, the Procuring Entity\u2019s rights or the successful Bidder\u2019s obligations under the Contract; or (iii)\u00a0the acceptance of which would unfairly affect the competitive position of other Bidders who have submitted substantially responsive bids.\n\n26.5\nIf a bid is not substantially responsive, it will be rejected by the Procuring Entity and may not subsequently be made responsive by the Bidder by correction of the nonconformity.  The Procuring Entity\u2019s determination of bid responsiveness will be based on the contents of the bid itself. \n\n\t27.\nConversion to Single Currency\n\t27.1\nFor evaluation and comparison purposes, the Procuring Entity shall convert all bid prices expressed in various currencies and amounts into a single currency specified in the BDS, using the selling exchange rate established by the source and on the date also specified in the BDS.\n\n\t28.\nEvaluation and Comparison of Bids\n\t28.1\nThe Procuring Entity will evaluate and compare the bids that have been determined to be substantially responsive, pursuant to ITB Clause 26.  The evaluation will be performed assuming either that:\n\n\t\n\t(a)\nthe Contract will be awarded to the lowest evaluated Bidder for the entire Information System; or\n\n(b)\nif specified in the BDS, Contracts will be awarded to the Bidders for each individual Subsystem, lot, or slice defined in the Technical Requirements whose bids result in the lowest combined evaluated price for the entire System.\n\n\nIn the latter case, discounts that are conditional on the award of more than one Subsystem, lot, or slice may be offered in bids.  However, such discounts will only be considered in the price evaluation if so confirmed in the BDS.\n28.2\nTo be considered for Contract award, Bidders must have submitted bids\n\n(a)\nfor which detailed bid evaluation using the same standards for compliance determination as listed in ITB Clauses\u00a026.3 and 26.4 confirms that the bids are commercially and technically responsive, and include the hardware, Software, related equipment, products, Materials, and other Goods and Services components of the Information System in, substantially, the full required quantities for the entire Information System or, if allowed in the BDS for ITB Clause\u00a028.1, the individual Subsystem, lot or slice bid on; and\n\n(b)\nThat offer Information Technologies that are proven to perform up to the standards promised in the bid by having successfully passed the performance, benchmark, and/or functionality tests the Procuring Entity may require, pursuant to ITB Clause\u00a031.2.\n\n\t\n\t28.3\nThe Procuring Entity\u2019s evaluation of a bid will be made on the basis of prices quoted in accordance with ITB Clause 14 (Bid Prices). \n\n\t\n\t28.4\nIf indicated by the BDS, the Procuring Entity\u2019s evaluation of responsive bids will take into account technical factors, in addition to cost factors.  An Evaluated Bid Score (B) will be calculated for each responsive bid using the following formula, which permits a comprehensive assessment of the bid price and the technical merits of each bid: \n\n\n\nwhere\n\nC\n=\nEvaluated Bid Price\n\nC low\n=\nthe lowest of all Evaluated Bid Prices among responsive bids\n\nT\n=\nthe total Technical Score awarded to the bid\n\nThigh\n=\nthe Technical Score achieved by the bid that was scored highest among all responsive bids\n\nX\n=\nweight for the Price as specified in the BDS\n\nThe bid with the highest Evaluated Bid Score (B) among responsive bids shall be termed the Lowest Evaluated Bid and is eligible for Contract award, provided the Bidder was prequalified and/or it was found to be qualified to perform the Contract in accordance with ITB Clause\u00a031 (Post-qualification).\n\n\t\n\t28.5\nIf, in addition to the cost factors, the Procuring Entity has chosen to give weight to important technical factors (i.e., the price weight, X, is less than 1 in the evaluation), that cannot be reduced to life-cycle costs or pass/fail criteria, the Total Technical Points assigned to each bid in the Evaluated Bid Formula will be determined by adding and weighting the scores assigned by an evaluation committee to technical features of the bid in accordance with the criteria set forth below.\n\n(a)\nThe technical features to be evaluated are generally defined below and specifically identified in the BDS:\n(i)\nPerformance, capacity, or functionality features that either exceed levels specified as mandatory in the Technical Requirements; and/or influence the life-cycle cost and effectiveness of the Information System.\n\n(ii)\nUsability features, such as ease of use, ease of administration, or ease of expansion, which influence the life-cycle cost and effectiveness of the Information System. \n\n(iii)\nThe quality of the Bidder\u2019s Preliminary Project Plan as evidenced by the thoroughness, reasonableness, and responsiveness of: (a) the task and resource schedules, both general and specific, and (b) the proposed arrangements for management and coordination, training, quality assurance, technical support, logistics, problem resolution, and transfer of knowledge, and other such activities as specified by the Procuring Entity in Section VI (Technical Requirements) or proposed by the Bidder based on the Bidder\u2019s experience.\n\n(b)\nFeature scores will be grouped into a small number of evaluation categories, generally defined below and specifically identified in the BDS, namely:\n\n(i)\nThe technical features that reflect how well the Information System meets the Procuring Entity\u2019s Business Requirements (including quality assurance and risk-containment measures associated with the implementation of the Information System).\n\n(ii)\nThe technical features that reflect how well the Information System meets the System\u2019s Functional Performance Standards.\n\n(iii)\nThe technical features that reflect how well the Information System meets the General Technical Requirements for hardware, network and communications, Software, and Services.\n\n(c)\nAs specified in the BDS, each category will be given a weight and within each category each feature may also be given a weight.\n\n(d)\nDuring the evaluation process, the evaluation committee will assign each desirable/preferred feature a whole number score from 0 to 4, where 0 means that the feature is absent, and 1 to 4 either represent predefined values for desirable features amenable to an objective way of rating (as is the case for, e.g., extra memory, or extra mass storage capacity, etc., if these extras would be conducive for the utility of the system), or if the feature represents a desirable functionality (e.g., of a software package) or a quality improving the prospects for a successful implementation (such as the strengths of the proposed project staff, the methodology, the elaboration of the project plan, etc., in the bid), the scoring will be 1 for the feature being present but showing deficiencies; 2 for meeting the requirements; 3 for marginally exceeding the requirements; and 4 for significantly exceeding the requirements.\n\n(e)\nThe score for each feature (i) within a category (j) will be combined with the scores of features in the same category as a weighted sum to form the Category Technical Score using the following formula: \n\n\n\nwhere:\n\ntji\n=  the technical score for feature \u201ci\u201d in category \u201cj\u201d\n\nwji\n=  the weight of feature \u201ci\u201d in category \u201cj\u201d\n\nk\n=  the number of scored features in category \u201cj\u201d\n\nand     \n \n\n(f)\nThe Category Technical Scores will be combined in a weighted sum to form the total Technical Bid Score using the following formula:\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\nSj\n=  the Category Technical Score of category \u201cj\u201d\n\nWj\n=  the weight of category \u201cj\u201d as specified in the BDS\nn\n=  the number of categories\n\n\nand     \n \n\n\t\n\t28.6\nThe Evaluated Bid Price (C) for each responsive bid will be determined as the sum of the Adjusted Supply and Installation Costs (P) plus the Recurrent Costs (R);\n\n\nwhere the Adjusted Supply and Installation Costs (P) are determined as:\n\n(a)\nThe price of the hardware, Software, related equipment, products, Materials and other Goods offered from within or from outside the Procuring Entity\u2019s Country, in accordance with ITB 14.4;  plus\n\n(b)\nThe total price for all software development, transportation, insurance, installation, customization, integration, Commissioning, testing, training, technical support, repair, and other Services, in accordance with ITB 14.5;\n\n(c)\nwith adjustments for:\n\n(i)\nDeviations proposed to the Implementation Schedule in the Technical Requirements resulting in delayed completion of the entire Information System, if permitted in the BDS and provided they do not exceed the maximum permissible delay period specified in the BDS.  For evaluation purposes, a pro rata increase of the total Supply and Installation Costs will be added using the percentage(s) specified in the BDS for each week of delay.  Bids offering deliveries beyond the maximum permissible delay specified may be rejected.\n\n(ii)\nDeviations taken to the Contract payment schedule specified in the SCC.  If deviations are permitted in the BDS, for evaluation purposes the total Supply and Installation Costs will be increased pro rata by the amount of interest that could otherwise be earned on the amount of any payments that would fall due under the proposed schedule earlier than the schedule stipulated in the SCC, at the interest rate specified in the BDS.\n(iii)\nGoods and Services that are required for the Information System but have been left out or are necessary to correct minor deviations of the bid will be added to the total Supply and Installation Costs using costs taken from the highest prices from other responsive bids for the same Goods and Services, or in the absence of such information, the cost will be estimated at prevailing list prices.  If the missing Goods and Services are a scored technical feature, the relevant score will be set at zero. \n\n(iv)\nCorrections to errors in arithmetic, in accordance with ITB Clause 26.2.\n\n(v)\nAny discounts offered for the award of more than one Subsystem, lot, or slice, if the BDS for ITB Clause 28.1 permits the consideration of discounts in the price evaluation.\n\n\t\n\t(d)\nThe Recurrent Costs (R) are reduced to net present value and determined using the following formula: \n\n\n\nwhere\n\nN\n=\nnumber of years of the Warranty Period, defined in SCC Clause 29.4\n\nM\n=\nnumber of years of the Post-Warranty Services Period, as defined in SCC Clause 1.1.(e) (xii) \n\nx\n=\nan index number 1, 2, 3, ... N + M representing each year of the combined Warranty Service and Post-Warranty Service Periods.\n\nRx\n=\ntotal Recurrent Costs for year \u201cx,\u201d as recorded in the Recurrent Cost Sub-Table.\n\nI\n=\ndiscount rate to be used for the Net Present Value calculation, as specified in the BDS.\n\n\t29.\nDomestic Preference\n\t29.1\nNo margin of domestic preference will apply.\n\n\t30.\nContacting the Procuring Entity\n\t30.1\nFrom the time of bid opening to the time of Contract award, if any Bidder wishes to contact the Procuring Entity on any matter related to the bid, it should do so in writing.\n\n\t\n\t30.2\nIf a Bidder tries to directly influence the Procuring Entity or otherwise interfere in the bid evaluation process and the Contract award decision, its bid may be rejected. \n\n\nF.  Post-qualification and Award of Contract\n\n\t31.\nPost\u200bqualification\n\t31.1\nThe Procuring Entity will determine at its own cost and to its satisfaction whether the Bidder (including Joint Venture Partners, and any Subcontractors for which the BDS for ITB Clause 6.1 (a) permits that their qualifications count towards the required Bidder qualifications) that is selected as having submitted the Lowest Evaluated Bid is qualified to perform the Contract satisfactorily, in accordance with ITB Clause 6.  If a prequalification process was undertaken for the Contract(s) for which these Bidding Documents were issued, the Procuring Entity will determine in the manner described above that no material changes have occurred after the prequalification that negatively affect the ability of the Bidder that has submitted the Lowest Evaluated Bid to perform the Contract.\n\n\t\n\t31.2\nPursuant to ITB Clauses 6 and 16, and as additionally may be specified in the BDS, the determination will evaluate the Bidder\u2019s financial, technical, design, integration, customization, production, management, and support capabilities and will be based on an examination of the documentary evidence of the Bidder\u2019s qualifications, as well as other information the Procuring Entity deems necessary and appropriate.  This determination may include visits or interviews with the Bidder\u2019s clients referenced in its bid, site inspections, and any other measures.  If so specified in the BDS, at the time of Postqualification the Procuring Entity may also carry out tests to determine that the performance or functionality of the Information System offered meets those stated in the Technical Requirements.\n\n\t\n\t31.3\nAn affirmative Postqualification determination will be a prerequisite for award of the Contract to the Lowest Evaluated Bidder.  A negative determination will result in rejection of the Bidder\u2019s bid, in which event the Procuring Entity will proceed to the next lowest evaluated Bidder to make a similar determination of that Bidder\u2019s capabilities to perform satisfactorily.\n\n\t32.\nAward Criteria\n\t32.1\nSubject to ITB Clause 34, the Procuring Entity will award the Contract to the Bidder whose bid has been determined to be substantially responsive and the Lowest Evaluated Bid, provided further that the Bidder has been determined to be qualified to perform the Contract satisfactorily, pursuant to ITB Clause 31.\n\n\t33.\nProcuring Entity\u2019s Right to Vary Quantities at Time of Award\n\t33.1\nThe Procuring Entity reserves the right at the time of Contract award to increase or decrease, by the percentage(s) indicated in the BDS, any of the following:\n\n\t\n\t(a)\nthe quantity of substantially identical Subsystems; or\n\n(b)\nthe quantity of individual hardware, Software, related equipment, Materials, products, and other Goods components of the Information System; or\n\n(c)\nthe quantity of Installation or other Services to be performed,\n\nfrom that originally specified in the Technical Requirements (as amended by any Addenda issued pursuant to ITB Clause 11), without any change in unit prices or other terms and conditions.\n\n\t34.\nProcuring Entity\u2019s Right to Accept Any Bid and to Reject Any or All Bids\n\t34.1\nThe Procuring Entity reserves the right to accept or reject any bid or to annul the bidding process and reject all bids at any time prior to Contract award, without thereby incurring any liability to the Bidders.\n\n\t35.\nNotification of Award\n\t35.1\nPrior to the expiration of the period of bid validity, the Procuring Entity shall notify the successful Bidder, in writing, that its bid has been accepted.\n\n\t\n\t35.2\nUntil a formal Contract is prepared and executed, the notification of award shall constitute a binding Contract.\n\n35.3\nThe Procuring Entity shall promptly publish in UNDB online and in dgMarket the results, identifying the bid and lot numbers and the following information: (i) name of each Bidder who submitted a bid; (ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening; (iii) name, evaluated price and, if the bidding conditions included scoring for technical quality, the technical score of each bid that was evaluated; (iv) name of Bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (v) name of the winning Bidder, the price it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract awarded. After publication of the award, unsuccessful Bidders may make a request in writing to the Procuring Entity for a debriefing seeking explanations on the grounds on which their bids were not selected. The Procuring Entity shall promptly respond in writing to any unsuccessful Bidder who, after publication of contract award, requests a debriefing.\n\n\t\n\t35.4\nUpon the successful Bidder furnishing the signed Contract Agreement and the Performance Security pursuant to ITB Clause 37, the Procuring Entity will promptly notify each unsuccessful Bidder, and will discharge all remaining Bid Securities, if any, as provided in ITB Clause 17.5\u00a0(c) and (d).\n\n\t36.\nSigning of Contract\n\t36.1\nAt the same time as the Procuring Entity notifies the successful Bidder that its bid has been accepted, the Procuring Entity will send the Bidder the Contract Agreement provided in the Bidding Documents, incorporating all agreements between the parties.\n\n\t\n\t36.2\nAs soon as practically possible, but no more than twenty-eight (28) days following receipt of the Contract Agreement, the successful Bidder shall sign and date it, and return it to the Procuring Entity.\n\n\t37.\nPerformance Security\n\t37.1\nAs soon as practically possible, but no more than twenty-eight (28) days following receipt of notification of award from the Procuring Entity, the successful Bidder shall furnish the Performance Security in accordance with the GCC, using the Performance Security form provided in the Bidding Documents or another form acceptable to the Procuring Entity.\n\n\t\n\t37.2\nFailure of the successful Bidder to comply with the requirements of ITB Clause 36 or ITB Clause 37.1 shall constitute sufficient grounds for the annulment of the award and, if and as applicable, execution of the Bid-Securing Declaration or forfeiture of the Bid Security, in which event the Procuring Entity may make the award to the next lowest evaluated bid submitted by a qualified Bidder or call for new bids.\n\n\t38.\nAdjudicator\n\t38.1\nUnless otherwise stated in the BDS, the Procuring Entity proposes that the person named in the BDS be appointed as Adjudicator under the Contract to assume the role of informal Contract dispute mediator, as described in GCC Clause 6.  In this case, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the named person is attached to the BDS.  The proposed hourly fee for the Adjudicator is specified in the BDS.  The expenses that would be considered reimbursable to the Adjudicator are also specified in the BDS.  If a Bidder does not accept the Adjudicator proposed by the Procuring Entity, it should state its non-acceptance in its Bid Submission Form and make a counterproposal of an Adjudicator and an hourly fee, attaching a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the alternative.  If the successful Bidder and the Adjudicator nominated in the BDS happen to be from the same country, and this is not the country of the Procuring Entity too, the Procuring Entity reserves the right to cancel the Adjudicator nominated in the BDS and propose a new one.  If by the day the Contract is signed, the Procuring Entity and the successful Bidder have not agreed on the appointment of the Adjudicator, the Adjudicator shall be appointed, at the request of either party, by the Appointing Authority specified in the SCC clause relating to GCC Clause 6.1.4, or if no Appointing Authority is specified there, the Contract will be implemented without an Adjudicator.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\nSection II.  Bid Data Sheet (BDS)\n\nBid Data Sheet\n\nThe following specific information relating to the System to be procured and the procurement procedures that will be used shall complement, supplement, or amend the provisions in the Instructions to Bidders (ITB).

The amount of the security shall be reduced in proportion to the value of the System executed by and paid to the Supplier from time to time and shall automatically become null and void when the full amount of the advance payment has been recovered by the Procuring Entity.  The way the value of the security is deemed to become reduced and, eventually, voided is as specified in the SCC.  The security shall be returned to the Supplier immediately after its expiration. \n\n\t\n\t13.3\nPerformance Security\n\n13.3.1\nThe Supplier shall, within twenty-eight (28) days of the notification of Contract award, provide a security for the due performance of the Contract in the amount and currency specified in the SCC.\n13.3.2\nThe security shall be a bank guarantee in the form provided in the Sample Forms Section of the Bidding Documents, or it shall be in another form acceptable to the Procuring Entity.\n\n13.3.3\nThe security shall automatically become null and void once all the obligations of the Supplier under the Contract have been fulfilled, including, but not limited to, any obligations during the Warranty Period and any extensions to the period.

If no Subcontractors are listed for an item, the Supplier shall prepare a list of Subcontractors it considers qualified and wishes to be added to the list for such items. The Supplier may from time to time propose additions to or deletions from any such list.  The Supplier shall submit any such list or any modification to the list to the Procuring Entity for its approval in sufficient time so as not to impede the progress of work on the System.  The Procuring Entity shall not withhold such approval unreasonably.  Such approval by the Procuring Entity of a Subcontractor(s) shall not relieve the Supplier from any of its obligations, duties, or responsibilities under the Contract.\n\n\t\n\t20.2\nThe Supplier may, at its discretion, select and employ Subcontractors for such critical items from those Subcontractors listed pursuant to GCC Clause\u00a020.1.  If the Supplier wishes to employ a Subcontractor not so listed, or subcontract an item not so listed, it must seek the Procuring Entity\u2019s prior approval under GCC Clause 20.3.\n\n20.3\nFor items for which pre-approved Subcontractor lists have not been specified in Appendix\u00a03 to the Contract Agreement, the Supplier may employ such Subcontractors as it may select, provided: (i)\u00a0the Supplier notifies the Procuring Entity in writing at least twenty-eight (28) days prior to the proposed mobilization date for such Subcontractor; and (ii)\u00a0by the end of this period either the Procuring Entity has granted its approval in writing or fails to respond.  The Supplier shall not engage any Subcontractor to which the Procuring Entity has objected in writing prior to the end of the notice period.  The absence of a written objection by the Procuring Entity during the above specified period shall constitute formal acceptance of the proposed Subcontractor.  Except to the extent that it permits the deemed approval of the Procuring Entity of Subcontractors not listed in the Contract Agreement, nothing in this Clause, however, shall limit the rights and obligations of either the Procuring Entity or Supplier as they are specified in GCC Clauses\u00a020.1 and 20.2, in the SCC, or in Appendix\u00a03 of the Contract Agreement.\n\n\t21.\nDesign and Engineering\n\t21.1\nTechnical Specifications and Drawings\n\n21.1.1\nThe Supplier shall execute the basic and detailed design and the implementation activities necessary for successful installation of the System in compliance with the provisions of the Contract or, where not so specified, in accordance with good industry practice.\n\n\t\n\tThe Supplier shall be responsible for any discrepancies, errors or omissions in the specifications, drawings, and other technical documents that it has prepared, whether such specifications, drawings, and other documents have been approved by the Project Manager or not, provided that such discrepancies, errors, or omissions are not because of inaccurate information furnished in writing to the Supplier by or on behalf of the Procuring Entity.\n\n21.1.2\nThe Supplier shall be entitled to disclaim responsibility for any design, data, drawing, specification, or other document, or any modification of such design, drawings, specification, or other documents provided or designated by or on behalf of the Procuring Entity, by giving a notice of such disclaimer to the Project Manager.\n\n21.2\nCodes and Standards\n\nWherever references are made in the Contract to codes and standards in accordance with which the Contract shall be executed, the edition or the revised version of such codes and standards current at the date twenty-eight (28) days prior to date of bid submission shall apply unless otherwise specified in the SCC.

If the System is put into production or use in this manner, the Supplier shall notify the Procuring Entity and document such use.\n\n27.3.2\nAt any time after any of the events set out in GCC Clause 27.3.1 have occurred, the Supplier may give a notice to the Project Manager requesting the issue of an Operational Acceptance Certificate.\n\n27.3.3\nAfter consultation with the Procuring Entity, and within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the Supplier\u2019s notice, the Project Manager shall:\n\n(a)\nissue an Operational Acceptance Certificate; or \n\n(b)\nnotify the Supplier in writing of any defect or deficiencies or other reason for the failure of the Operational Acceptance Tests; or\n\n(c)\nissue the Operational Acceptance Certificate, if the situation covered by GCC Clause\u00a027.3.1\u00a0(b) arises.\n27.3.4\nThe Supplier shall use all reasonable endeavors to promptly remedy any defect and/or deficiencies and/or other reasons for the failure of the Operational Acceptance Test that the Project Manager has notified the Supplier of.  Once such remedies have been made by the Supplier, the Supplier shall notify the Procuring Entity, and the Procuring Entity, with the full cooperation of the Supplier, shall use all reasonable endeavors to promptly carry out retesting of the System or Subsystem.  Upon the successful conclusion of the Operational Acceptance Tests, the Supplier shall notify the Procuring Entity of its request for Operational Acceptance Certification, in accordance with GCC Clause\u00a027.3.3.  The Procuring Entity shall then issue to the Supplier the Operational Acceptance Certification in accordance with GCC Clause\u00a027.3.3\u00a0(a), or shall notify the Supplier of further defects, deficiencies, or other reasons for the failure of the Operational Acceptance Test.  The procedure set out in this GCC Clause\u00a027.3.4 shall be repeated, as necessary, until an Operational Acceptance Certificate is issued.\n\n27.3.5\nIf the System or Subsystem fails to pass the Operational Acceptance Test(s) in accordance with GCC Clause\u00a027.2, then either:\n\n(a)\nthe Procuring Entity may consider terminating the Contract, pursuant to GCC Clause 41.2.2; \n\nor\n\n(b)\nif the failure to achieve Operational Acceptance within the specified time period is a result of the failure of the Procuring Entity to fulfill its obligations under the Contract, then the Supplier shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations with respect to the relevant technical and functional aspects of the Contract, and GCC Clauses 30.3 and 30.4 shall not apply.\n\n27.3.6\nIf within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the Supplier\u2019s notice the Project Manager fails to issue the Operational Acceptance Certificate or fails to inform the Supplier in writing of the justifiable reasons why the Project Manager has not issued the Operational Acceptance Certificate, the System or Subsystem shall be deemed to have been accepted as of the date of the Supplier\u2019s said notice.\n\n27.4\nPartial Acceptance\n\n27.4.1\nIf so specified in the SCC for GCC Clause 27.2.1, Installation and Commissioning shall be carried out individually for each identified major component or Subsystem(s) of the System.  In this event, the provisions in the Contract relating to Installation and Commissioning, including the Operational Acceptance Test, shall apply to each such major component or Subsystem individually, and Operational Acceptance Certificate(s) shall be issued accordingly for each such major component or Subsystem of the System, subject to the limitations contained in GCC Clause 27.4.2.\n27.4.2\nThe issuance of Operational Acceptance Certificates for individual major components or Subsystems pursuant to GCC Clause 27.4.1 shall not relieve the Supplier of its obligation to obtain an Operational Acceptance Certificate for the System as an integrated whole (if so specified in the SCC for GCC Clauses 12.1 and 27.2.1) once all major components and Subsystems have been supplied, installed, tested, and commissioned.\n27.4.3\nIn the case of minor components for the System that by their nature do not require Commissioning or an Operational Acceptance Test (e.g., minor fittings, furnishings or site works, etc.), the Project Manager shall issue an Operational Acceptance Certificate within fourteen (14) days after the fittings and/or furnishings have been delivered and/or installed or the site works have been completed.  The Supplier shall, however, use all reasonable endeavors to promptly remedy any defects or deficiencies in such minor components detected by the Procuring Entity or Supplier. \n\n\nF.  Guarantees and Liabilities\n\n\t28.\nOperational Acceptance Time Guarantee\n\t28.1\nThe Supplier guarantees that it shall complete the supply, Installation, Commissioning, and achieve Operational Acceptance of the System (or Subsystems, pursuant to the SCC for GCC Clause 27.2.1) within the time periods specified in the Implementation Schedule in the Technical Requirements Section and/or the Agreed and Finalized Project Plan pursuant to GCC Clause 8.2, or within such extended time to which the Supplier shall be entitled under GCC Clause 40 (Extension of Time for Achieving Operational Acceptance). \n\n\t\n\t28.2\nIf the Supplier fails to supply, install, commission, and achieve Operational Acceptance of the System (or Subsystems pursuant to the SCC for GCC Clause 27.2.1) within the time for achieving Operational Acceptance specified in the Implementation Schedule in the Technical Requirement or the Agreed and Finalized Project Plan, or any extension of the time for achieving Operational Acceptance previously granted under GCC Clause 40 (Extension of Time for Achieving Operational Acceptance), the Supplier shall pay to the Procuring Entity liquidated damages at the rate specified in the SCC as a percentage of the Contract Price, or the relevant part of the Contract Price if a Subsystem has not achieved Operational Acceptance.  The aggregate amount of such liquidated damages shall in no event exceed the amount specified in the SCC (\u201cthe Maximum\u201d).  Once the Maximum is reached, the Procuring Entity may consider termination of the Contract, pursuant to GCC Clause 41.2.2.\n28.3\nUnless otherwise specified in the SCC, liquidated damages payable under GCC Clause\u00a028.2 shall apply only to the failure to achieve Operational Acceptance of the System (and Subsystems) as specified in the Implementation Schedule in the Technical Requirements and/or Agreed and Finalized Project Plan.  This Clause\u00a028.3 shall not limit, however, any other rights or remedies the Procuring Entity may have under the Contract for other delays.\n\n28.4\nIf liquidated damages are claimed by the Procuring Entity for the System (or Subsystem), the Supplier shall have no further liability whatsoever to the Procuring Entity in respect to the Operational Acceptance time guarantee for the System (or Subsystem).  However, the payment of liquidated damages shall not in any way relieve the Supplier from any of its obligations to complete the System or from any other of its obligations and liabilities under the Contract.\n\n\t29.\nDefect Liability\n\t29.1\nThe Supplier warrants that the System, including all Information Technologies, Materials, and other Goods supplied and Services provided, shall be free from defects in the design, engineering, Materials, and workmanship that prevent the System and/or any of its components from fulfilling the Technical Requirements or that limit in a material fashion the performance, reliability, or extensibility of the System and/or Subsystems.

Upon receipt of the Supplier\u2019s Change Estimate Proposal, the Procuring Entity shall do one of the following:\n\n(a)\naccept the Supplier\u2019s estimate with instructions to the Supplier to proceed with the preparation of the Change Proposal;\n\n(b)\nadvise the Supplier of any part of its Change Estimate Proposal that is unacceptable and request the Supplier to review its estimate;\n\n(c)\nadvise the Supplier that the Procuring Entity does not intend to proceed with the Change.\n\n39.2.3\nUpon receipt of the Procuring Entity\u2019s instruction to proceed under GCC Clause\u00a039.2.2\u00a0(a), the Supplier shall, with proper expedition, proceed with the preparation of the Change Proposal, in accordance with GCC Clause\u00a039.2.1.  The Supplier, at its discretion, may specify a validity period for the Change Proposal, after which if the Procuring Entity and Supplier has not reached agreement in accordance with GCC Clause\u00a039.2.6, then GCC Clause\u00a039.2.7 shall apply.\n\n39.2.4\nThe pricing of any Change shall, as far as practicable, be calculated in accordance with the rates and prices included in the Contract.  If the nature of the Change is such that the Contract rates and prices are inequitable, the parties to the Contract shall agree on other specific rates to be used for valuing the Change.\n\n39.2.5\nIf before or during the preparation of the Change Proposal it becomes apparent that the aggregate impact of compliance with the Request for Change Proposal and with all other Change Orders that have already become binding upon the Supplier under this GCC Clause\u00a039 would be to increase or decrease the Contract Price as originally set forth in Article\u00a02 (Contract Price) of the Contract Agreement by more than fifteen (15) percent, the Supplier may give a written notice of objection to this Request for Change Proposal prior to furnishing the Change Proposal.  If the Procuring Entity accepts the Supplier\u2019s objection, the Procuring Entity shall withdraw the proposed Change and shall notify the Supplier in writing of its acceptance.\n\nThe Supplier\u2019s failure to so object to a Request for Change Proposal shall neither affect its right to object to any subsequent requested Changes or Change Orders, nor affect its right to take into account, when making such subsequent objection, the percentage increase or decrease in the Contract Price that any Change not objected to by the Supplier represents.\n\n39.2.6\nUpon receipt of the Change Proposal, the Procuring Entity and the Supplier shall mutually agree upon all matters contained in the Change Proposal.  Within fourteen (14) days after such agreement, the Procuring Entity shall, if it intends to proceed with the Change, issue the Supplier a Change Order.  If the Procuring Entity is unable to reach a decision within fourteen (14) days, it shall notify the Supplier with details of when the Supplier can expect a decision.  If the Procuring Entity decides not to proceed with the Change for whatever reason, it shall, within the said period of fourteen (14) days, notify the Supplier accordingly.  Under such circumstances, the Supplier shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs reasonably incurred by it in the preparation of the Change Proposal, provided that these do not exceed the amount given by the Supplier in its Change Estimate Proposal submitted in accordance with GCC Clause\u00a039.2.2.\n\n39.2.7\nIf the Procuring Entity and the Supplier cannot reach agreement on the price for the Change, an equitable adjustment to the Time for Achieving Operational Acceptance, or any other matters identified in the Change Proposal, the Change will not be implemented.  However, this provision does not limit the rights of either party under GCC Clause\u00a06 (Settlement of Disputes).\n\n39.3\nChanges Originating from Supplier\n\nIf the Supplier proposes a Change pursuant to GCC Clause\u00a039.1.2, the Supplier shall submit to the Project Manager a written \u201cApplication for Change Proposal,\u201d giving reasons for the proposed Change and including the information specified in GCC Clause\u00a039.2.1.  Upon receipt of the Application for Change Proposal, the parties shall follow the procedures outlined in GCC Clauses\u00a039.2.6 and 39.2.7.  However, should the Procuring Entity choose not to proceed or the Procuring Entity and the Supplier cannot come to agreement on the change during any validity period that the Supplier may specify in its Application for Change Proposal, the Supplier shall not be entitled to recover the costs of preparing the Application for Change Proposal, unless subject to an agreement between the Procuring Entity and the Supplier to the contrary.\n\n\t40.\nExtension of Time for Achieving Operational Acceptance\n\t40.1\nThe time(s) for achieving Operational Acceptance specified in the Schedule of Implementation shall be extended if the Supplier is delayed or impeded in the performance of any of its obligations under the Contract by reason of any of the following:\n\n\t\n\t(a)\nany Change in the System as provided in GCC Clause\u00a039 (Change in the Information System);\n\n(b)\nany occurrence of Force Majeure as provided in GCC Clause\u00a038 (Force Majeure); \n\n(c)\ndefault of the Procuring Entity; or\n\n(d)\nany other matter specifically mentioned in the Contract;\n\nby such period as shall be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and as shall fairly reflect the delay or impediment sustained by the Supplier.\n\n40.2\nExcept where otherwise specifically provided in the Contract, the Supplier shall submit to the Project Manager a notice of a claim for an extension of the time for achieving Operational Acceptance, together with particulars of the event or circumstance justifying such extension as soon as reasonably practicable after the commencement of such event or circumstance.  As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such notice and supporting particulars of the claim, the Procuring Entity and the Supplier shall agree upon the period of such extension.  In the event that the Supplier does not accept the Procuring Entity\u2019s estimate of a fair and reasonable time extension, the Supplier shall be entitled to refer the matter to the provisions for the Settlement of Disputes pursuant to GCC Clause\u00a06.\n\n40.3\nThe Supplier shall at all times use its reasonable efforts to minimize any delay in the performance of its obligations under the Contract.\n\n\t41.\nTermination\n\t41.1\nTermination for Procuring Entity\u2019s Convenience\n\n\t\n\t41.1.1\nThe Procuring Entity may at any time terminate the Contract for any reason by giving the Supplier a notice of termination that refers to this GCC Clause\u00a041.1.\n\n41.1.2\nUpon receipt of the notice of termination under GCC Clause\u00a041.1.1, the Supplier shall either as soon as reasonably practical or upon the date specified in the notice of termination\n\n(a)\ncease all further work, except for such work as the Procuring Entity may specify in the notice of termination for the sole purpose of protecting that part of the System already executed, or any work required to leave the site in a clean and safe condition;\n\n(b)\nterminate all subcontracts, except those to be assigned to the Procuring Entity pursuant to GCC Clause\u00a041.1.2\u00a0(d)\u00a0(ii) below;\n\n(c)\nremove all Supplier\u2019s Equipment from the site, repatriate the Supplier\u2019s and its Subcontractors\u2019 personnel from the site, remove from the site any wreckage, rubbish, and debris of any kind;\n\n(d)\nin addition, the Supplier, subject to the payment specified in GCC Clause\u00a041.1.3, shall\n\n(i)\ndeliver to the Procuring Entity the parts of the System executed by the Supplier up to the date of termination;\n\n(ii)\nto the extent legally possible, assign to the Procuring Entity all right, title, and benefit of the Supplier to the System, or Subsystem, as at the date of termination, and, as may be required by the Procuring Entity, in any subcontracts concluded between the Supplier and its Subcontractors;\n\n(iii)\nDeliver to the Procuring Entity all nonproprietary drawings, specifications, and other documents prepared by the Supplier or its Subcontractors as of the date of termination in connection with the System.\n\n41.1.3\nIn the event of termination of the Contract under GCC Clause\u00a041.1.1, the Procuring Entity shall pay to the Supplier the following amounts:\n\n(a)\nthe Contract Price, properly attributable to the parts of the System executed by the Supplier as of the date of termination;\n\n(b)\nthe costs reasonably incurred by the Supplier in the removal of the Supplier\u2019s Equipment from the site and in the repatriation of the Supplier\u2019s and its Subcontractors\u2019 personnel;\n\n(c)\nany amount to be paid by the Supplier to its Subcontractors in connection with the termination of any subcontracts, including any cancellation charges;\n\n(d)\ncosts incurred by the Supplier in protecting the System and leaving the site in a clean and safe condition pursuant to GCC Clause\u00a041.1.2 (a); and \n(e)\nThe cost of satisfying all other obligations, commitments, and claims that the Supplier may in good faith have undertaken with third parties in connection with the Contract and that are not covered by GCC Clauses\u00a041.1.3\u00a0(a) through (d) above.\n\n41.2\nTermination for Supplier\u2019s Default\n\n41.2.1\nThe Procuring Entity, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies it may possess, may terminate the Contract forthwith in the following circumstances by giving a notice of termination and its reasons therefore to the Supplier, referring to this GCC Clause\u00a041.2:\n(a)\nif the Supplier becomes bankrupt or insolvent, has a receiving order issued against it, compounds with its creditors, or, if the Supplier is a corporation, a resolution is passed or order is made for its winding up (other than a voluntary liquidation for the purposes of amalgamation or reconstruction), a receiver is appointed over any part of its undertaking or assets, or if the Supplier takes or suffers any other analogous action in consequence of debt;\n\n(b)\nif the Supplier assigns or transfers the Contract or any right or interest therein in violation of the provision of GCC Clause\u00a042 (Assignment); or\n\n(c)\nif the Supplier, in the judgment of the Procuring Entity, has engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices, in competing for or in executing the Contract, including but not limited to willful misrepresentation of facts concerning ownership of Intellectual Property Rights in, or proper authorization and/or licenses from the owner to offer, the hardware, software, or materials provided under this Contract.\n\nFor the purposes of this Clause:\n\n(i)\n\u201ccorrupt practice\u201d\n is the offering, giving, receiving or soliciting, directly or indirectly, of anything of value to influence improperly the actions of another party;\n\n(ii)\n\u201cfraudulent practice\u201d\n is any act or omission, including a misrepresentation, that knowingly or recklessly misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party to obtain a financial or other benefit or to avoid an obligation;\n\n(iii)\n\u201ccollusive practice\u201d\n is an arrangement between two or more parties designed to achieve an improper purpose, including to influence improperly the actions of another party;\n\n(iv)\n\u201ccoercive practice\u201d\n is impairing or harming, or threatening to impair or harm, directly or indirectly, any party or the property of the party to influence improperly the actions of a party;\n\n(v)\n\u201cobstructive practice\u201d is\n(aa)\ndeliberately destroying, falsifying, altering or concealing of evidence material to the investigation or making false statements to investigators in order to materially impede a Government investigation into allegations of a corrupt, fraudulent, coercive or collusive practice; and/or threatening, harassing or intimidating any party to prevent it from disclosing its knowledge of matters relevant to the investigation or from pursuing the investigation; or\n(bb)\nacts intended to materially impede the exercise of the Government\u2019s inspection and audit rights provided for under Sub-Clause 9.8.\n41.2.2\nIf the Supplier:\n\n(a)\nhas abandoned or repudiated the Contract;\n\n(b)\nhas without valid reason failed to commence work on the System promptly;\n\n(c)\npersistently fails to execute the Contract in accordance with the Contract or persistently neglects to carry out its obligations under the Contract without just cause;\n\n(d)\nrefuses or is unable to provide sufficient Materials, Services, or labor to execute and complete the System in the manner specified in the Agreed and Finalized Project Plan furnished under GCC Clause\u00a019 at rates of progress that give reasonable assurance to the Procuring Entity that the Supplier can attain Operational Acceptance of the System by the Time for Achieving Operational Acceptance as extended;\n\nthen the Procuring Entity may, without prejudice to any other rights it may possess under the Contract, give a notice to the Supplier stating the nature of the default and requiring the Supplier to remedy the same.  If the Supplier fails to remedy or to take steps to remedy the same within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of such notice, then the Procuring Entity may terminate the Contract forthwith by giving a notice of termination to the Supplier that refers to this GCC Clause\u00a041.2.\n\n41.2.3\nUpon receipt of the notice of termination under GCC Clauses\u00a041.2.1 or 41.2.2, the Supplier shall, either immediately or upon such date as is specified in the notice of termination:\n\n(a)\ncease all further work, except for such work as the Procuring Entity may specify in the notice of termination for the sole purpose of protecting that part of the System already executed or any work required to leave the site in a clean and safe condition;\n\n(b)\nterminate all subcontracts, except those to be assigned to the Procuring Entity pursuant to GCC Clause\u00a041.2.3\u00a0(d) below;\n\n(c)\ndeliver to the Procuring Entity the parts of the System executed by the Supplier up to the date of termination;\n\n(d)\nto the extent legally possible, assign to the Procuring Entity all right, title and benefit of the Supplier to the System or Subsystems as at the date of termination, and, as may be required by the Procuring Entity, in any subcontracts concluded between the Supplier and its Subcontractors;\n\n(e)\ndeliver to the Procuring Entity all drawings, specifications, and other documents prepared by the Supplier or its Subcontractors as at the date of termination in connection with the System.\n\n41.2.4\nThe Procuring Entity may enter upon the site, expel the Supplier, and complete the System itself or by employing any third party.  Upon completion of the System or at such earlier date as the Procuring Entity thinks appropriate, the Procuring Entity shall give notice to the Supplier that such Supplier\u2019s Equipment will be returned to the Supplier at or near the site and shall return such Supplier\u2019s Equipment to the Supplier in accordance with such notice.  The Supplier shall thereafter without delay and at its cost remove or arrange removal of the same from the site.\n\n41.2.5\nSubject to GCC\u00a0Clause 41.2.6, the Supplier shall be entitled to be paid the Contract Price attributable to the portion of the System executed as at the date of termination and the costs, if any, incurred in protecting the System and in leaving the site in a clean and safe condition pursuant to GCC Clause\u00a041.2.3 (a).  Any sums due the Procuring Entity from the Supplier accruing prior to the date of termination shall be deducted from the amount to be paid to the Supplier under this Contract.\n\n41.2.6\nIf the Procuring Entity completes the System, the cost of completing the System by the Procuring Entity shall be determined.  If the sum that the Supplier is entitled to be paid, pursuant to GCC Clause\u00a041.2.5, plus the reasonable costs incurred by the Procuring Entity in completing the System, exceeds the Contract Price, the Supplier shall be liable for such excess.  If such excess is greater than the sums due the Supplier under GCC Clause\u00a041.2.5, the Supplier shall pay the balance to the Procuring Entity, and if such excess is less than the sums due the Supplier under GCC Clause\u00a041.2.5, the Procuring Entity shall pay the balance to the Supplier.  The Procuring Entity and the Supplier shall agree, in writing, on the computation described above and the manner in which any sums shall be paid.\n\n41.3\nTermination by Supplier\n\n41.3.1\nIf:\n\n(a)\nthe Procuring Entity has failed to pay the Supplier any sum due under the Contract within the specified period, has failed to approve any invoice or supporting documents without just cause pursuant to the SCC, or commits a substantial breach of the Contract, the Supplier may give a notice to the Procuring Entity that requires payment of such sum, with interest on this sum as stipulated in GCC Clause\u00a012.3, requires approval of such invoice or supporting documents, or specifies the breach and requires the Procuring Entity to remedy the same, as the case may be.  If the Procuring Entity fails to pay such sum together with such interest, fails to approve such invoice or supporting documents or give its reasons for withholding such approval, fails to remedy the breach or take steps to remedy the breach within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the Supplier\u2019s notice; or\n\n(b)\nthe Supplier is unable to carry out any of its obligations under the Contract for any reason attributable to the Procuring Entity, including but not limited to the Procuring Entity\u2019s failure to provide possession of or access to the site or other areas or failure to obtain any governmental permit necessary for the execution and/or completion of the System;\n\nthen the Supplier may give a notice to the Procuring Entity of such events, and if the Procuring Entity has failed to pay the outstanding sum, to approve the invoice or supporting documents, to give its reasons for withholding such approval, or to remedy the breach within twenty-eight (28) days of such notice, or if the Supplier is still unable to carry out any of its obligations under the Contract for any reason attributable to the Procuring Entity within twenty-eight (28) days of the said notice, the Supplier may by a further notice to the Procuring Entity referring to this GCC Clause\u00a041.3.1, forthwith terminate the Contract.\n\n41.3.2\nThe Supplier may terminate the Contract immediately by giving a notice to the Procuring Entity to that effect, referring to this GCC Clause\u00a041.3.2, if the Procuring Entity becomes bankrupt or insolvent, has a receiving order issued against it, compounds with its creditors, or, being a corporation, if a resolution is passed or order is made for its winding up (other than a voluntary liquidation for the purposes of amalgamation or reconstruction), a receiver is appointed over any part of its undertaking or assets, or if the Procuring Entity takes or suffers any other analogous action in consequence of debt.\n\n41.3.3\nIf the Contract is terminated under GCC Clauses\u00a041.3.1 or 41.3.2, then the Supplier shall immediately:\n\n(a)\ncease all further work, except for such work as may be necessary for the purpose of protecting that part of the System already executed, or any work required to leave the site in a clean and safe condition;\n\n(b)\nterminate all subcontracts, except those to be assigned to the Procuring Entity pursuant to Clause\u00a041.3.3 (d) (ii);\n\n(c)\nremove all Supplier\u2019s Equipment from the site and repatriate the Supplier\u2019s and its Subcontractor\u2019s personnel from the site.\n\n(d)\nIn addition, the Supplier, subject to the payment specified in GCC Clause\u00a041.3.4, shall:\n\n(i)\ndeliver to the Procuring Entity the parts of the System executed by the Supplier up to the date of termination;\n\n(ii)\nto the extent legally possible, assign to the Procuring Entity all right, title, and benefit of the Supplier to the System, or Subsystems, as of the date of termination, and, as may be required by the Procuring Entity, in any subcontracts concluded between the Supplier and its Subcontractors;\n\n(iii)\nto the extent legally possible, deliver to the Procuring Entity all drawings, specifications, and other documents prepared by the Supplier or its Subcontractors as of the date of termination in connection with the System.\n\n41.3.4\nIf the Contract is terminated under GCC Clauses\u00a041.3.1 or 41.3.2, the Procuring Entity shall pay to the Supplier all payments specified in GCC Clause\u00a041.1.3, and reasonable compensation for all loss, except for loss of profit, or damage sustained by the Supplier arising out of, in connection with, or in consequence of such termination.\n\n41.3.5\nTermination by the Supplier pursuant to this GCC Clause\u00a041.3 is without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the Supplier that may be exercised in lieu of or in addition to rights conferred by GCC Clause\u00a041.3.\n\n41.4\nIn this GCC Clause\u00a041, the expression \u201cportion of the System executed\u201d shall include all work executed, Services provided, and all Information Technologies, or other Goods acquired (or subject to a legally binding obligation to purchase) by the Supplier and used or intended to be used for the purpose of the System, up to and including the date of termination.\n\n41.5\nIn this GCC Clause\u00a041, in calculating any monies due from the Procuring Entity to the Supplier, account shall be taken of any sum previously paid by the Procuring Entity to the Supplier under the Contract, including any advance payment paid pursuant to the SCC.\n\n\t42.\nAssignment\n\t42.l\nNeither the Procuring Entity nor the Supplier shall, without the express prior written consent of the other, assign to any third party the Contract or any part thereof, or any right, benefit, obligation, or interest therein or thereunder, except that the Supplier shall be entitled to assign either absolutely or by way of charge any monies due and payable to it or that may become due and payable to it under the Contract.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\nSection V.  Special Conditions of Contract (SCC)\n\nNotes on preparing the Special Conditions of Contract (SCC)\n\n\nThe SCC are analogous to the Bid Data Sheet (BDS) in that they are used to specify in one place all the important information, deletions, changes, and additions relating to a standard part of the Bidding Documents necessary to provide proper contractual coverage for a particular Information System (System).  In this instance, the deletions, changes, and additions relate to the General Conditions of Contract (GCC).  Users should avoid in general, however, introducing major changes to the GCC.  The standard GCC provisions provide a balanced framework within which a System can be supplied and installed that is fair to both the Procuring Entity and the successful Bidder.  Major changes can upset this balance and therefore will require the clearance of the Regional Procurement Advisor.  \n\n\nAs for the BDS, illustrative sample text and explanatory notes are provided for each Special Condition to assist the Procuring Entity in preparing more appropriate and focused SCC.  Much of the sample text may be adopted directly.  The Procuring Entity may have to modify or expand the suggested text, however, to accommodate the specific circumstances of the Procuring Entity, the Procuring Entity\u2019s Country and/or the System the Procuring Entity wishes to procure.  In particular, the Procuring Entity must ensure that the SCC clearly and completely specify:\n\n(a)\nall the Contract-specific information that the GCC explicitly state will be specified in the SCC (e.g., governing law and language, names of the Procuring Entity and the Supplier, currency(ies) of payment);\n\n(b)\nany modifications to the GCC that are required so that the Contract fits the specific circumstances of the System (e.g., details of the operational acceptance tests that will be carried out or the specific nature of any maintenance service obligations that the Supplier will have to carry out); \n\n(c)\nAny GCC clause, sub-clause that is non-applicable and should be deleted; and\n\n(d)\nAny additional Contract conditions called for by the specific nature of the procurement and the risks associated with it, which are not adequately covered by the standard GCC.\n\n\nSince the SCC complete, complement, and extend the GCC, the structure of the SCC presented here is designed to mirror that of the GCC themselves.  For ease of use, most, if not all SCC clauses should be explicitly linked to specific standard GCC clauses and sub-clauses and be presented in the same sequence.  The Procuring Entity should take great care to maintain and verify the accuracy of all cross references used linking the two sections.  Also, in preparing the SCC, the Procuring Entity should avoid at all costs introducing duplications and/or contradictions between the SCC and the GCC.  When such contradictions occur, the SCC prevail over the GCC, but in the process they create ambiguity and confusion that can undermine the Procuring Entity\u2019s ability to exercise its rights under the Contract.  In addition to maintaining the harmony between the SCC and the GCC, the Procuring Entity should also ensure that the Technical Requirements (and the Implementation Schedule that is part of the Technical Requirements) and the SCC remain internally consistent.  \n\n\nThese SBD are written so that a single Contract can cover, if needed, all the supply and service responsibilities potentially required throughout the life-cycle of a typical Information System, including:\n\n(a)\nThe period covering the supply, Delivery, Pre-commissioning, Installation, Commissioning, and Operational Acceptance of the System;\n\n(b)\nThe Warranty Period, following Operational Acceptance, during which the System is in use and the Supplier remains liable for the repair of any defects that are discovered in the System, and to provide any other Services specified in these SCC; and\n\n(c)\nThe Post-Warranty Services Period, during which the Supplier is obligated to provide those Goods and Services that were: (i) identified in the Recurrent Cost Sub-Table and (ii) specified in Clause 7.3 of the SCC as obligations of the Supplier.  These obligations may include, for example: providing software licenses annually, emergency repair and other technical support, hardware and software maintenance, etc.  \n\n\nIn addition to specifying these items in the Recurrent Cost Sub-Table of the Bidding Document and incorporating them into the bid evaluation process specified in the ITB and BDS, the Procuring Entity must also specify the technical and other features of these recurrent obligations in the Technical Requirements and/or the SCC.  For example, the coverage period, the required response times, and how the maintenance services are carried out all need to be defined.\n\nTable of Clauses\n\n135A.

Subject Matter of Contract\n\n7.\nScope of the System (GCC Clause 7)\n\n\tGCC 7.3\n\tThe Supplier\u2019s obligations under the Contract will include the following recurrent cost items, as identified in the Recurrent Cost tables in the Supplier\u2019s Bid: \n- The Supplier agrees to supply spare parts required for the operation and maintenance of the System, as stated below, for [two\u00a0(2No.) years] beginning with Operational Acceptance.  Moreover, the price of such spare parts shall be those specified in the spare parts price schedule submitted by the Suppler as part of its bid.  These prices shall include the purchase price for such spare parts and other costs and expenses (including the Supplier\u2019s fees) relating to the supply of spare parts. \n\n\n8.\nTime for Commencement and Operational Acceptance (GCC Clause 8)\n\n\tGCC 8.1\n\tThe Supplier shall commence work on the System within:  [immediately after issuance of acceptance letter or contract signing] from the Effective Date of the Contract.\n\n\tGCC 8.2\n\tOperational Acceptance will occur on or before:  [ Thirty (30No.) days POST GO LIVE ]\n\n\n9.\nSupplier\u2019s Responsibilities (GCC Clause 9)\n\n\tGCC 9.9\n\tThe Supplier shall have the following additional responsibilities: [N/A].\n\n\n10.\nProcuring Entity\u2019s Responsibilities (GCC Clause 10)\n\n\tGCC 10.12\n\tThe Procuring Entity shall have the following additional responsibilities:  [Provide the necessary human resource required throughout various stages of the implementation/Project].\n\n\nC.  Payment\n\n11.\nContract Price (GCC Clause 11)\n\n\tGCC 11.2 (b)\n\tAdjustments to the Contract Price shall be as follows:  [Price shall be fixed and all delivered systems].\n\n\n12.\nTerms of Payment (GCC Clause 12)\n\n\tGCC 12.1\n\tSubject to the provisions of GCC Clause 12 (Terms of Payment), the Procuring Entity shall pay the Contract Price to the Supplier according to the categories and in the manner specified below.  Only the categories Advance Payment and Complete System Integration relate to the entire Contract Price.  In other payment categories, the term \"total Contract Price\" means the total cost of goods or services under the specific payment category.  Within each such category, the Contract Implementation Schedule may trigger pro-rata payments for the portion of the total Contract Price for the category corresponding to the goods or services actually Delivered, Installed, or Operationally Accepted, at unit prices and in the currencies specified in the Price Schedules of the Contract Agreement.\n\n (a)\nAdvance Payment \nTwenty Five percent (25%) of the entire Contract Price, exclusive of all Recurrent Costs, shall be paid against receipt of a claim accompanied by the Advance Payment Security specified in GCC Clause 13.2.\n\nThe advance payment is meant to help the supplier with mobilization.\n\n (b)\nStage payments for Information Technologies, Materials, and other Goods, with the exception of Custom Software and Custom Materials shall be as follows: \nTwenty Five percent (25%) payment shall be made on Hardware acceptance \u2013 Upon verification of hardware installation and issuance of Hardware Acceptance Certificate.\n(c)\nServices other than Training 50% broken down as follows:\n\u00b7 Forty Percent (40%) payment shall be made after Service acceptance \u2013 Upon service and integration testing and issuance of Service Acceptance Certificate.\n\n\u00b7 Ten percent (10%) of the Contract price shall be paid after full training and Final acceptance \u2013 3 months after issuance of Service Acceptance Certificate.\n\n (d)\nSupport Recurrent Costs N/A\nOne hundred percent (100%) of the price of the recurrent support services actually delivered will be paid in arrears, on submission and Procuring Entity\u2019s approval of invoices.\n\n\tGCC 12.3\n\tThe Procuring Entity shall pay to the Supplier interest on the delayed payments at a rate of:  [N/A] per annum.\n\n\tGCC 12.4\n\tFor Goods and Services supplied locally, the Procuring Entity will pay the Supplier in [Zambia Kwacha].  \n\n\tGCC 12.5\n\tPayment for Goods supplied from outside the Procuring Entity\u2019s Country shall be in the form of: [Telegraphic Transfer].\n\n\n13.\nSecurities (GCC Clause 13)\n\n\tGCC 13.2.1\n\tThe Supplier shall provide within twenty-eight (28) days of the notification of Contract award an Advance Payment Security in the amount and currency of the Advance Payment specified in SCC for GCC Clause 12.1 above.\n\n\tGCC 13.2.2\n\tThe reduction in value and expiration of the Advance Payment Security are calculated as follows:  [state, for example:\n\n\n\u201cP*a/(100-a), where \u201cP\u201d is the sum of all payments effected so far to the Supplier (excluding the Advance Payment), and \u201ca\u201d is the Advance Payment expressed as a percentage of the Contract Price pursuant to the SCC for GCC 12.1.\u201d \n\n\tGCC 13.3.1\n\tThe Performance Security shall be denominated in [US Dollar] for an amount equal to ten [10%] percent of the Contract Price, excluding any Recurrent Costs.\n\n\tGCC 13.3.4\n\tDuring the Warranty Period (after Operational Acceptance of the System), the Performance Security shall be reduced to two [2%] percent of the Contract Price, excluding any Recurrent Costs.\n\n\n\n\n14.\nTaxes and Duties (GCC Clause 14)\n\n\tGCC 14\n\t             [All equipment for the system shall be delivered CIP Incoterms and Zamtel shall pay Customs duty and VAT on imported equipment while the supplier shall pay Withholding Tax on Services performed in Zambia during the performance of the contract].\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\nD.  Intellectual Property\n\n15.\nCopyright (GCC Clause 15)\n\n\tGCC 15.3\n\tThe Procuring Entity may assign, license, or otherwise voluntarily transfer its contractual rights to use the Standard Software or elements of the Standard Software, without the Supplier\u2019s prior written consent, under the following circumstances:\n\n[\u00a0Not applicable]\n\n\n\tGCC 15.4\n\tThe Procuring Entity\u2019s and Supplier\u2019s rights and obligations with respect to Custom Software or elements of the Custom Software are as follows [Not applicable].  \n\nThe Procuring Entity\u2019s and Supplier\u2019s rights and obligations with respect to Custom Materials or elements of the Custom Materials are as follows [ Not applicable].\nNote:\nThere is a broad spectrum of strategies that the Procuring Entity can adopt regarding Intellectual Property Rights in Custom Software (and in Custom Materials).  One extreme case is that the Procuring Entity retains all Intellectual Property Rights and tightly restricts what the Supplier can do with the Custom Software and information related to it.  This approach may be appropriate when the Procuring Entity has highly sensitive procedures embedded in the Custom Software (e.g., a central bank\u2019s settlement system) or commercial competitive concerns regarding wider use of the Software, designs, or information, or where the Procuring Entity considers that it is contributing valuable know-how to the development of the Custom Software and wishes to share in future profits with the Supplier that derives from exploitation of that know-how.  The other extreme case is where the Procuring Entity retains no Intellectual Property Rights in the Custom Software and only licenses its use from the Supplier.  This approach is most appropriate when the Supplier wants to take advantage of the potential cost reduction in allowing the Supplier to commercialize the Custom Software (rather than sharing in future profits) and where the Procuring Entity has no proprietary or commercial concerns regarding its reuse.\n\n\nA wide variety of intermediate arrangements can be appropriate, depending on the circumstances.  These would entail variations of what the Procuring Entity is entitled to do with the software, designs, and related information (and under what conditions).  These rights and obligations include the following: (i) duplicating and using the software on different equipment, such as back-ups, additional computers, replacements, upgraded units, etc.; (ii) transferring the license or sublicensing the software for other entities to use, modify, develop, commercialize, etc.; (iii) sharing proprietary information regarding the Custom Software with various parties.  The Procuring Entity\u2019s obligations and rights (and the conditions under which those rights and obligations apply) can vary substantially also.  These include: (i) what the Procuring Entity must and can do with the CASE files, Source Code, and executable code of the Custom Software; (ii) sharing, reselling, and otherwise providing access to the software, designs and related information; and (iii) auditing for license compliance. \n\n\nThe Supplier\u2019s rights in relation to the Custom Software may:\n\n\u00b7 Be limited to use in order to support the Procuring Entity; or \n\n\u00b7 Extend to commercial exploitation by re-licensing to third-party customers.\n\nIf the Supplier\u2019s rights extend to commercial exploitation, they may be limited as follows:\n\n\u00b7 There may be an interim period, designed to protect the Procuring Entity\u2019s competitive edge, during which the Supplier is not permitted to exploit commercially; and/or\n\n\u00b7 The Supplier may be prohibited from licensing the Custom Software to certain categories of customer (for example, direct competitors of the Procuring Entity) or in certain territories (for example, the Procuring Entity\u2019s Country), either for a limited period or indefinitely; and/or\n\n\u00b7 The Supplier may be required to pay royalties to the Procuring Entity when it licenses third parties to use the Custom Software.\n\n\nThe first two of these categories of limitation are intended to protect the Procuring Entity\u2019s competitive edge.  The third is intended to allow the Procuring Entity to share in future profits made by the Supplier through exploitation of the Custom Software.  Royalty arrangements will have to be backed up by obligations to report to the Procuring Entity regarding future sales of products to which royalties apply and audit rights so that the Procuring Entity can check that the Supplier\u2019s reports are accurate.  Clearly, if royalty arrangements are put in place, the value of the Custom Software to the Supplier is reduced, so the Procuring Entity may not benefit from an up-front cost saving.\n\n\nThe Procuring Entity\u2019s rights in relation to the Custom Software may also be restricted to \u201cuser\u201d rights or extended to commercial exploitation.  If the Procuring Entity is to be treated as a mere user of the Custom Software, it might accept restrictions on use similar to those imposed in relation to the Standard Software (indeed, the default position in the GCC is that the Custom Software will be licensed to the Procuring Entity on exactly the same terms as the Standard Software if the Intellectual Property Rights in the Custom Software does not vest in the Procuring Entity).  It may, however, also expect to have access to, and a right to use, CASE files and Source Code to the Custom Software (whereas, at best, Source Code to the Standard Software is likely to be deposited in escrow).\n\n\nIf the Procuring Entity is to be permitted to exploit the Custom Software commercially, its exploitation rights may be limited in similar ways to the ways in which the Procuring Entity\u2019s own usage rights to the Custom Software may be limited.\n\n\nIt may be appropriate to apply different arrangements to various elements of the Custom Software, according to their commercial sensitivity and potential for exploitation and the degree of competitive advantage that they afford to the Procuring Entity.\n\n\nThe various possible arrangements can be achieved by a variety of contractual mechanisms.  Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights in the Custom Software may vest the Supplier or the Procuring Entity, with the owner of those rights granting an appropriate license to the other party.  This license may be subject to various degrees of exclusivity, depending on the desired commercial outcome (for example, the Supplier may own the Intellectual Property Rights in the Custom Software by granting to the Procuring Entity a license that is exclusive, in relation to exploitation in the Procuring Entity\u2019s Country, for two years).\n\n\nIf an exclusive license is to be granted, competition law issues will need to be considered in some jurisdictions.\n\n\nEach is sufficiently different as to render virtually all sample text inappropriate in numerous cases.  Accordingly, the Procuring Entity of Custom Software will, in most instances, require the services of an appropriately skilled lawyer to draft SCC for the rights and obligations regarding Custom Software (more particularly, the variety of rights and obligations that potentially apply to different items of Custom Software).\n\n\tGCC 15.5\n\tIf not applicable, state:  \u201cNo software escrow contract is required for the execution of the Contract;\u201d [Not applicable].\nNote: \nSpecial software escrow arrangements are generally needed in relation to Contracts for the supply of Software, particularly Application Software, where there is concern about the ability of the Supplier to provide ongoing support throughout the life of the System.  The protection provided by an escrow arrangement, however, should be weighed against the costs of administering it.  The actual language of the escrow contract will vary depending on the laws of the country in which the escrow deposit is to be made (which may be the Procuring Entity\u2019s Country or another country with a suitable legal regime) and the escrow agent selected (escrow agents generally have their own standard form contracts).  Provisions may cover:\n\n \n(i)\nthe Supplier\u2019s obligations to deliver the Source Code to the escrow agent and make replacement deposits to ensure that the Source Code is up to date;\n\n\n(ii)\nthe Supplier\u2019s warranties that the Source Code is at all times capable of being used to generate the latest version of the executable code to the relevant Software in use by the Procuring Entity and suitable to enable the Procuring Entity to support and develop the Software;\n\n\n(iii)\nthe escrow agent\u2019s obligations to keep the Source Code secure and confidential;\n\n\n(iv)\nthe escrow agent\u2019s obligations in relation to verification of the Source Code (to ensure that it is Source Code and that it is capable of generating the executable code);\n\n\n(v)\nthe obligations of the Supplier and the Procuring Entity in relation to payment of the escrow agent\u2019s fee;\n\n\n(vi)\nthe escrow agent\u2019s right and obligation to release the Source Code to the Procuring Entity in certain specified \u201crelease events\u201d (e.g., bankruptcy or insolvency of the Supplier or the Supplier\u2019s failure to make deposits or to support the Software);\n\n\n(vii)\nlimitations and exclusions of the escrow agent\u2019s liability;\n\n\n(viii)\nthe circumstances in which the escrow arrangement will terminate, and what will happen to the deposited Source Code on termination; and\n\n\n(ix)\nConfidentiality undertakings to be given by the Procuring Entity on release of the Source Code.\n\n\n16.\nSoftware License Agreements (GCC Clause 16)\n\n\tGCC 16.1 (a) (iii)\n\tThe Standard Software license shall be valid [\u201cthroughout the territory of the Procuring Entity\u2019s Country;\u201d and to cover the area in which the Procuring Entity\u2019s business group operates in.].\n\n\tGCC 16.1\u00a0(a)\u00a0(iv)\n\tUse of the software shall be subject to the following additional restrictions [\u201cnone\u201d].\nNote:\nIn the interest of soliciting lower bid prices, Procuring Entity\u2019s may wish to consider defining limitations in the use of the software.  For example:\n\n(a)\nrestrictions on the number of records in particular categories that may be held by the System;\n\n(b)\nrestrictions on the numbers of transactions in particular categories that may be processed by the System in any day, week, month, or other specified period;\n\n(c)\nrestrictions on the number of persons who may be authorized to use the System at any time;\n\n(d)\nrestrictions on the number of persons who may access the System simultaneously at any time; or\n\n(e)\nRestrictions on the number of workstations that may be connected to the System at any time.\n\n\nNote that, from the point of view of the Procuring Entity, if restrictions of any of these kinds (or any similar kind) are to be imposed and there is a real likelihood that the limits may be reached, it would be better to specify additional license fees that are payable when the limits are reached rather than imposing an absolute prohibition on exceeding the limits.\n\n\tGCC 16.1 (b) (ii)\n\tThe Software license shall permit the Software to be used or copied for use or transferred to a replacement computer [\u00a0\u201cprovided the replacement computer falls within approximately the same class of machine and maintains approximately the same number of users, if a multi-user machine\u201d].\n\n\tGCC 16.1 (b) (vi)\n\tThe Software license shall permit the Software to be disclosed to and reproduced for use (including a valid sublicense) by [Not applicable], subject to the same restrictions set forth in this Contract.\n\nNote: \nThe Procuring Entity may also wish to specify, for example, that such entities shall be not direct competitors of the Supplier.\n\n\tGCC 16.1 (b) (vii)\n\tIn addition to the persons specified in GCC Clause\u00a016.1 (b) (vi), the Software may be disclosed to, and reproduced for use by, [Not applicable] subject to the same restrictions as are set forth in this Contract.\n\nNote:\nThe Procuring Entity may, for example, wish to specify the members of the Procuring Entity\u2019s business group that are not direct competitors of the Supplier and that the Procuring Entity must obtain and provide the Supplier written evidence from such parties that such parties will abide by the terms of the Contract as if they were party to the Contract.\n\n\tGCC 16.2\n\tThe Supplier\u2019s right to audit the Standard Software will be subject to the following terms: \n\nNote: \nSuch terms may include, for example:\n\n[The Procuring Entity will make available to the Supplier within seven (7) days of a written request accurate and up-to-date records of the number and location of copies, the number of authorized users, or any other relevant data required to demonstrate use of the Standard Software as per the license agreement]\n\nor\n\n\n[if on-site audits are acceptable, the Procuring Entity may specify conditions on the duration and number of audits per year;  the hours or days during which audits may be conducted;  the categories of software subject to audit;  the procedures for access to Procuring Entity\u2019s hardware or software; the number and affiliation of individual auditors;  the timing and terms of advance notice; the indemnity by Supplier for losses, liabilities, and costs incurred by the Procuring Entity as a direct result of the audit]\n\n\n17.\nConfidential Information (GCC Clause 17)\n\n\tGCC 17.1\n\tState:  \u201cThere are no modifications to the confidentiality terms expressed in GCC Clause\u00a017.1\u201d.\n\n\tGCC 17.7\n\tThe provisions of this GCC Clause 17 shall survive the termination, for whatever reason, of the Contract for [TBA].\n\n\nE.

The Procuring Entity shall, within [\u00a0(7) days of receipt of the Project Plan, notify the Supplier of any respects in which it considers that the Project Plan does not adequately ensure that the proposed program of work, proposed methods, and/or proposed Information Technologies will satisfy the Technical Requirements and/or the SCC (in this Clause 19.2 called \u201cnon-conformities\u201d below).  The Supplier shall, within [five (5)] days of receipt of such notification, correct the Project Plan and resubmit to the Procuring Entity.  The Procuring Entity shall, within [two (2)] days of resubmission of the Project Plan, notify the Supplier of any remaining non-conformities.  This procedure shall be repeated as necessary until the Project Plan is free from non-conformities.  When the Project Plan is free from non-conformities, the Procuring Entity shall provide confirmation in writing to the Supplier.  This approved Project Plan (\u201cthe Agreed and Finalized Project Plan\u201d) shall be contractually binding on the Procuring Entity and the Supplier.

To require the Supplier to provide for free only new releases and updates, but agreeing that it would be reimbursed for the supply of complete new versions might be more cost-effective.  Other solutions might be to shorten the time period during which updates, etc., would have to be supplied for free, for example, to only the first year of the Warranty Period; or alternatively, a more narrow set of Standard Software could be covered.\n\n\n24.\nImplementation, Installation, and Other Services (GCC Clause 24)\n\n\tGCC 24\n\tInsert: and appropriate clauses, or state \u201cThere are no Special Conditions of Contract applicable to GCC Clause 24.\u201d\n\nNote: \nThe Services appropriate for a particular System may include maintenance services during the Post-Warranty Service Period.  They may also include a prearranged amount or type of technical assistance (e.g., systems analysis or programming in relation to subsequent expansions of the System) or certain types of operation support, such as network management or ongoing data conversion.

It is imperative that the Procuring Entity prepare the specification for these tests as carefully as the overall specification of the System itself.  The description should be sufficiently comprehensive, unambiguous, and verifiable to result in proper operation of the System with minimal confusion or controversy between the Procuring Entity and its management, the Supplier, and any users.\n\n\nIn addition, where the Contract covers the Installation and acceptance testing of a number of Subsystems, the nature of the acceptance tests required for each Subsystem, and for the final tests to be carried out on the entire System once all Subsystems have been completed, needs to be clearly specified here and/or in the Technical Requirements and which party bears responsibility for correcting any defects discovered during the final tests of the entire System needs to be identified.\n\n\tGCC 27.2.2\n\tIf the Operational Acceptance Test of the System, or Subsystem(s), cannot be successfully completed within [\u00a0ninety (90)\u00a0] days from the date of Installation or any other period agreed upon by the Procuring Entity and the Supplier, then GCC Clause\u00a027.3.5\u00a0(a) or (b) shall apply, as the circumstances may dictate.\n\n\nF.

Technical Requirements (including Implementation Schedule)\n\nNotes on preparing the Technical Requirements\n\n\nThe Technical Requirements should include all the technical details that Bidders need, in combination with the Implementation Schedule and the supporting System Inventory Tables, to prepare realistic, responsive, and competitive bids. \n\n\nThe Technical Requirements should, as much as possible, be based on and expressed in terms of the Procuring Entity\u2019s business, rather than technological needs.  This leaves it up to the market to determine what specific Information Technologies can best satisfy these business needs.  Nevertheless, in the case of a relatively straight-forward Information System, where the business needs have been clearly linked to technological requirements, it would be acceptable to prepare Technical Requirements that describe technologies known to satisfy those business needs.  Even in these cases, however, the requirements must be vendor neutral and specified to elicit the widest range of possible technical responses.  \n\n\nReferences to brand names, catalog numbers, or other details that limit the source of any item or component to a specific manufacturer should be avoided.  Where such references are unavoidable, the words \u201cor substantially equivalent\u201d should be added to permit Bidders to bid equivalent or superior technologies.  Only in the most exceptional circumstances may Bidders be required to offer brand-name items and the equivalency clause be omitted.  ZPPA\u2019s consideration for exception requires that:  \n\n(a)\na brand-name component appears to have no equivalent or superior alternative, because of its unique ability to reliably interoperate with a relatively large base of existing technologies, to conform with the Procuring Entity\u2019s adopted technological standards, and to offer overwhelming savings in terms of avoided costs for retraining, data conversion, macro / business template redevelopment, etc.;\n\n(b)\nZPPA has agreed in advance, during project preparation, that such brand-name restrictions are warranted; and\n\n(c)\nsuch brand-name components are the absolute fewest possible and each component has been explicitly identified in the Bid Data Sheet for ITB Clause\u00a016.3 (ITB Clause 14.3 in the two-stage SBD).\n\n\nSimilarly, where national standards or codes of practice are specified, the Procuring Entity should include a statement that other national or international standards \u201cthat are substantially equivalent\u201d will also be acceptable.\n\n\nTo help ensure comparable bids and ease Contract execution, the Procuring Entity\u2019s requirements must be stated as clearly as possible, with minimum room for differing interpretations.  Thus, wherever possible, technical specifications should include definitive characteristics and quantifiable measures.  If technical characteristics in a specific range, or above or below specific thresholds, are required, then these should be clearly specified.  For example, the expandability of a server should be stated as \u201cno less than four processors.\u201d  Technical specifications that state only \u201cfour processors\u201d create unnecessary uncertainty for Bidders regarding whether or not, for example, a server that could be expanded up to six processor boards would be technically responsive.  \n\n\nQuantitative technical specifications must, however, be employed with care.  They can dictate technical architectures and, thus, be unnecessarily restrictive.  For example, a quantitative requirement for the minimum width of the data path in a processor may be unnecessarily restrictive.  Instead, a specification of a required level of standard performance benchmark test may be more appropriate, allowing different technical approaches to achieving the Procuring Entity\u2019s functional and performance objectives.  In general, the Procuring Entity should try to use widely accepted direct measures of performance and functionality whenever possible and carefully review specifications for those that might dictate technical architectures.  \n\n\nIt is important that the Requirements clearly identify which are mandatory features (for which a bid\u2019s nonconformance might require rejection for non-responsiveness) and which are preferable features that can be included or excluded from a bid at the Bidder\u2019s option. To enhance the clarity of the specifications, Procuring Entitys are advised to use the word \u201cMUST\u201d (in bold capitals) in sentences describing mandatory requirements.  The Technical Responsiveness Checklist is also a useful device to ensure that mandatory and preferred features are clearly indicated.\n\n\nThis section of the SBD contains a sample outline that will help Procuring Entitys organize and present in a comprehensive way both the business purpose and technical characteristics of the System to be supplied and installed.  The major sections are:  \n\n(A)\nBackground (description of the project, history, and structure of the agency, purpose of the System, etc.)\n\n(B)\nBusiness Function and Performance Requirements \n\n(C)\nTechnical Specifications\n\n(D)\nTesting Requirements\n\n(E)\nImplementation Schedule\n\n(F)\nRequired Format for Technical Bid \n\n(G)\nTechnical Responsiveness Checklist\n\n(H)\nAttachments (e.g., drawings of site premises, descriptions of existing technologies, sample data, and reports, etc.)\n\nPreparation of the Implementation Schedule in Chapter E warrants further explanation and guidance.\n\nNotes on preparing the Implementation Schedule\n\n\nThe Implementation Schedule presents in summary form: \n\n(a)\nthe key Information Technologies, Materials, and other Goods and Services that comprise the System to be supplied and/or performed by the successful Bidder (including a breakdown showing all Subsystems); \n\n(b)\nthe quantities of such Information Technologies, Materials, and other Goods and Services; \n\n(c)\nthe site(s) where the System will be installed and the services performed; and \n\n(d)\nwhen Installation, and Operational Acceptance should take place for all Subsystems and/or major components of the System, and the overall System itself, as well as any other major Contract milestones.  Note that the delivery date is not presented in the Implementation Schedule but left for bidders to provide.  Delivery, under Incoterms 2000 for CIP, refers to the shipment date when the Supplier delivers the goods to the first carrier at the port of embarkation, not to the arrival of the goods at the destination site.  Delivery (shipment) date therefore varies according to the country of origin of the goods and the Supplier's chosen method of transport. \n\n\nThe target completion dates given in the Implementation Schedule must be realistic, and the Schedule itself must contain enough clear information to enable Bidders to quickly prepare responsive bids with realistic and competitive prices.  These prices are to submitted in the format of the Price Schedules included in the Sample Forms Section of these SBD.  Thus, the breakdown provided in the Implementation Schedule should closely mirror that given in the Price Schedules.  If inconsistencies are introduced in these two key forms, confusion and delays will likely occur during the evaluation.  \n\n\nThe Implementation Schedule also fulfills a variety of other important functions:  \n\n(a)\nthe performance milestones in the Schedule are used to construct the payment schedule given in the Special Conditions of Contract; \n\n(b)\nthe Schedule is a key tool that the Procuring Entity utilizes to monitor and supervise day-to-day performance by the Supplier;\n\n(c)\nthe application of the liquidated damages provision in the General Conditions of Contract is linked directly to the dates given in the Schedule; and \n\n(d)\nthe quantities for each item shown in the Schedule are used as the starting point for any quantity variations the Procuring Entity may wish to request at the time of Contract award pursuant to ITB Clause\u00a033.1 (ITB Clause\u00a045.1 in the two-stage SBD).\n\n\nThe sample tables provided in this section of the SBD are designed to help the Procuring Entity organize and present the necessary information.  They comprise: \n\n(a)\nan Implementation Schedule Table; \n\n(b)\nSystem Inventory Tables (Supply and Installation cost items and Recurrent cost items); \n\n(c)\na Site Table(s); and \n\n(d)\na Table of Holidays and other Non-Working Days.  \n\n\nThe Procuring Entity should modify these tables, as required, to suit the particulars of the System (and Subsystems) to be supplied and installed.  The sample text provided for various sections of the tables is illustrative only and should be modified or deleted as appropriate.\n\n\nThe Implementation Schedule Table should provide: \n\n(a)\nbrief identifying descriptions for the major Subsystems and/or major components of the System and the site(s) where they will be installed; \n\n(b)\nthe Procuring Entity\u2019s required completion time, specified in weeks from the Effective Date of the Contract, for Installation and Achieving Operational Acceptance, for each Subsystem and major component, as well as for Operational Acceptance of the entire System itself (if required); and \n\n(c)\na clear indication of which completion date(s) would be used for assessment of Liquidated Damages.\n\nIn specifying the Schedule, it is essential that the target completion dates be realistic and achievable in light of the capacity of both the average Supplier and the Procuring Entity to carry out their respective contract obligations.  Also, the Procuring Entity must take care to ensure that the dates specified in the Schedule are consistent with any specified elsewhere in the Bidding Document, especially in the SCC (e.g., in relation to the Time for Achieving Operational Acceptance and/or times specified for the submission and acceptance of the Agreed and Finalized Project Plan).\n\n\nThe System Inventory Tables give a more detailed description of each of the Information Technologies, Materials, and other Goods and Services needed for the System (broken down by Subsystem, if applicable), the required quantities of each, and the location of each on a specific site (e.g., building, floor, room, department, etc.).  Each entry in the System Inventory Tables should be cross referenced to the relevant section of the Technical Requirements where that component is described in greater detail.  There are two sample formats given for the System Inventory Tables: one for the Supply and Installation cost items and the second for recurrent cost items needed (if any).  The second version of the table permits the Procuring Entity to obtain price information about items that are needed during the Warranty and Post-Warranty Service Periods.\n\n\nThe Site Table(s) provides information regarding the physical location of the site(s) where the System is to be supplied, installed, and operated.  The site(s) may consist of a number of branch offices in remote regions, different departments or offices in the same city, or a combination of these.  The Procuring Entity must specify this information in sufficient detail so that Bidders can accurately estimate costs related to:\n\n(a)\nDelivery and insurance;\n\n(b)\nInstallation, including cabling and inter-building communications, etc.;\n\n(c)\nany subcontracts needed to perform post-warranty operational support services, such as emergency repair, maintenance, and other support services; and\n\n(d)\nany other related Service obligations the successful Bidder will have to perform under the Contract, including related travel and subsistence costs.\n\nThis information will also help Bidders identify which site(s) may warrant a site visit during the period they are preparing their bids.  If the System presents complex installation problems, a detailed site layout drawings should be included in the Bidding Document.\n\n\nIf the System comprises a number of Subsystems or components that can be supplied and installed separately and are organized into separate \u201clots\u201d for bidding, evaluation, and Contract award purposes, each such lot should be described in separate sets of Implementation Schedule, System Inventory, and Site Tables.\n\nTable of Contents:  Technical Requirements\n\n160A.

Background\n\n0.1\nThe Procuring Entity\nZamtel serves as the implementing agency for the projects and intends to procure a circuit switched cloud solution from a reputable supplier with a vast experience in the delivery and installation of the said equipment. \nB.

Required Format of Technical Bids\n\n5.1\nDescription of Information Technologies, Materials, Other Goods, and Services\n\n5.1.0\nThe Bidder must provide detailed descriptions of the essential technical, performance, or other relevant characteristics of all key Information Technologies, Materials, other Goods, and Services offered in the bid (e.g., version, release, and model numbers).  Without providing sufficient clear detail, Bidders run the risk of their bids being declared non-responsive.  \n\n5.1.1\nTo assist in the bid evaluation, the detailed descriptions should be organized and cross referenced in the same manner as the Bidder\u2019s item-by-item commentary on the Technical Requirements described in Section 5.2 below.  All information provided by cross reference must, at a minimum, include clear titles and page numbers.  \n\n5.1.2\n[\u00a0specify: any other technical information related to the Information Technologies, Materials, other Goods, and Services necessary to assess the responsiveness of the Technical Bid, for example, histories of the Information Technologies offered, if demonstrated capacity to revise and extend these technologies is a mandatory criterion for technical responsiveness to be used in the evaluation.\u00a0]\n5.2\nItem-by-Item Commentary on the Technical Requirements\n\n5.2.0\nThe Bidder must provide an item-by-item commentary on the Procuring Entity\u2019s Technical Requirements, demonstrating the substantial responsiveness of the overall design of the System and the individual Information Technologies, Goods, and Services offered to those Requirements, see ITB Clause\u00a016.2\u00a0(b) (ITB Clause\u00a014.2\u00a0(b) in the two-stage SBD).\n\n5.2.1\nIn demonstrating the responsiveness of its bid, the Bidder is strongly urged to use the Technical Responsiveness Checklist provided in Section G of the Technical Requirements.  Failure to do so, increases significantly the risk that the Bidder\u2019s Technical Bid will be declared technically non-responsive.  Among other things, the checklist should contain explicit cross references to the relevant pages in the Bidder\u2019s Technical Bid. \n\n5.3\nPreliminary Project Plan\n\n5.3.0\nThe Bidder must prepare a Preliminary Project Plan describing, among other things, the methods and human and material resources that the Bidder proposes to employ in the design, management, coordination, and execution of all its responsibilities, if awarded the Contract, as well as the estimated duration and completion date for each major activity. The Preliminary Project Plan must also address the topics and points of emphasis specified in \n[ state:  \u201cSCC Clause\u00a019\u201d including any additional items stated in the Bid Data Sheet for ITB Clause\u00a016.2\u00a0(c) (ITB Clause\u00a014.2\u00a0(c) in the two-stage SBD)\u00a0]. The Preliminary Project Plan should also state the Bidder\u2019s assessment of the major responsibilities of the Procuring Entity and any other involved third parties in System supply and installation, as well as the Bidder\u2019s proposed means for coordinating activities by each of the involved parties to avoid delays or interference.   \n\n5.3.1\nIn addition to the topics and points of emphasis, the Preliminary Project Plan MUST address [ for example, specify: what steps will be taken if there is a failure; how project progress will be reported; etc.\u00a0].\n5.3.2\n[ specify:  any additional requirements regarding the format of the Preliminary Project Plan, for example, must it be submitted in a specific word processing format, in addition to hard copy, etc.\u00a0].\n5.4\nConfirmation of Responsibility for Integration and Interoperability of Information Technologies\n\n5.4.0\nThe Bidder must submit a written confirmation that, if awarded the Contract, it shall accept responsibility for successful integration and interoperability of all the proposed Information Technologies included in the System, as further specified in the Bidding Document.\n\nG.  Technical Responsiveness Checklist\n\nNote on Preparation of the Checklist for Procuring Entity\u2019s:  The following is a sample format that is designed to help Bidders quickly understand: \n\n(a)\nThe Technical Specification given in the Technical Requirements; \n\n(b)\nWhether each Requirement is mandatory or only \u201cpreferred\u201d; and \n\n(c)\nTo ensure that each Bidder includes along with a specific response to the Procuring Entity, a cross reference to the supporting information provided elsewhere in its Technical Bid.  \n\nIt is important that the tables be prepared carefully and completely, with accurate references to the relevant section and paragraph numbers in the Technical Requirements so that Bidders will be more likely to submit complete information, particularly regarding the mandatory and scored Requirements.  In preparing each Checklist entry, Procuring Entitys should start with an abbreviated text of each Requirement so that Bidders can quickly confirm that they are responding to the right Requirement.  Inconsistencies between the Checklist and the referenced section in the Technical Requirements should be avoided. Giving Bidders a revisable, \u201celectronic\u201d version of the Checklist as part of the Bidding Document will enhance the completeness of bids.\n\nTechnical Responsiveness Checklist\n\nNote to Bidders:  The following Checklist is provided to help the Bidder organize and consistently present its Technical Bid.  For each of the following Technical Requirements, the Bidder must describe how its Technical Bid responds to each Requirement.  In addition, the Bidder must provide cross references to the relevant supporting information, if any, included in the bid.  The cross reference should identify the relevant document(s), page number(s), and paragraph(s).  The Technical Responsiveness Checklist does not supersede the rest of the Technical Requirements (or any other part of the Bidding Documents).  If a requirement is not mentioned in the Checklist that does not relieve the Bidder from the responsibility of including supporting evidence of compliance with that other requirement in its Technical Bid.  One- or two-word responses (e.g. \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d \u201cWill comply,\u201d etc.) are normally not sufficient to confirm technical responsiveness with Technical Requirements.\n\n\tTech.

Sample Forms\n\nNotes to the Procuring Entity on preparing the Sample Forms\n\n\nThe Sample Forms provided in these SBD provide standard formats for a number of the key documents that the Procuring Entity and Bidders will exchange in the process of bidding, awarding, and implementing the Contract.  Most of the Sample Forms are to be completed and/or modified by the Procuring Entity to suit the particular System being procured and included in the Bidding Document before they are released to potential Bidders, or to the winning Bidder, as the case may be.  In turn, the Bidders or winning Bidder must complete other forms and submit them to the Procuring Entity.  Notes providing instructions for the Procuring Entity, the Bidders, and the winning Bidder have been provided.  To avoid confusion, the Procuring Entity should remove all the instructions to the Procuring Entity from the final version of the Bidding Document that is released to potential Bidders.  \n\n\nTo the fullest extent possible, the typographical aides used in the previous sections of the SBD continue in this section.  General explanatory text that appears in sans serif typeface (such as this text) remains intended for the Procuring Entity (hence should be removed from the final version of the Bidding Document).  General instructions or explanatory text aimed at Bidders and/or the winning Bidder appear in standard roman typeface, but indicators are included showing they are aimed at Bidders.  Instructions that appear directly in the Forms, continue to be in italicized roman typeface, set off with square brackets and generally intended for the Bidders or the winning Bidder.  If an instruction is meant for the Procuring Entity, it is identified as such.  Procuring Entitys are encouraged to provide as many of these Sample Forms as possible in revisable, electronic format in or with the Bidding Document.  This will expedite bid preparation, reduce the number of inadvertent mistakes made by Bidders, and, as a result, simplify the evaluation.\n\n\nBid Submission Form and Contract Agreement:  Except as indicated by blanks and/or instructions to fill in information, the text of the Bid Submission Form and the Contract Agreement should be left unaltered in the Bidding Document from how it appears in these SBDs. At the time of Contract award, the Procuring Entity has an opportunity to add the final details needed in the Contract Agreement form, by making any necessary insertions or changes to Article 1.1 (Contract Documents) and Article 3 (Effective Date) and listing only the actual Appendices that will be incorporated in the final Contract.  (These Appendices should also be completed in accordance with the instructions provided at the beginning of each Appendix.)  \n\n\nSince the Price Schedules will form part of the final Contract, if there have been any corrections or modifications to the winning bid resulting from price corrections, pursuant to the Instructions to Bidders, these too should be reflected in the Price Schedules at the time of Contract award and appended to the Contract Agreement in Appendix 6 (Revised Price Schedules).\n\n\nPrice Schedules:  The price breakdown given in the sample Price Schedules generally follows the usual breakdown requested for Information Technology procurement, except that further breakdowns are required (e.g., between Technologies/Goods and Services, and between Technologies and other Goods supplied domestically or from abroad) in order for the domestic preference procedure to be applied (except if the procurement falls under the 2004 Guidelines, in which case domestic preference does not apply in this SBD).  It is essential that Bidders submit their prices in the manner prescribed by the Price Schedules.  Failure to do so may result in loss of the preference, if applicable.\n\n\nFor the more straightforward or well specified Systems that are covered by the single-stage bidding process, the Procuring Entity is encouraged to fill in the precise System, Subsystem, component, and item/description details in the Price Schedules prior to issuance of the Bidding Document.  This will result in bid pricing that is more uniform, making the comparison of bid prices more efficient and reducing the number of ambiguities that require clarification.  If Bidders are left to fill in item/description details (which may be necessary for complex Systems when such details cannot be easily identified in advance by the Procuring Entity), the commercial evaluation becomes more difficult.  Other guidance and instructions appear in the subsection containing the schedules and in the schedules themselves.\n\n\nManufacturer\u2019s Authorizations and agreements by key subcontractors:  In accordance with ITB Clauses 6.1\u00a0(b) and (c), Bidders may be required to submit, as part of their bids, Manufacturer\u2019s Authorizations and written agreements by Subcontractors proposed for key services.  For the Manufacturer's Authorization, the format provided in the SBD should be used.  There is no particular format for Subcontractor agreements.\n\n\nList of Proposed Subcontractors:  In accordance with ITB Clause 6.3, a Bidder must submit, as part of its bid, a list of major goods and/or services that the Bidder proposes to subcontract.  The list should also include the names and place of registration of the Subcontractors proposed for each item and a summary of their qualifications.\n\n\nList of Software and Materials:  In accordance with ITB Clause\u00a013.1\u00a0(e)\u00a0(vi) (ITB Clauses\u00a013.1\u00a0(c)\u00a0(vi) and 25.1\u00a0(e)\u00a0(vi) in the two-stage SBD), a Bidder must submit, as part of its bid, a list of all the Software it will provide, assigning each item to one of the following categories: (A) System, General-Purpose, or Application Software; or (B) Standard or Custom Software.  The Bidder must also submit a list of all Custom Materials.  These should be recorded in the sample List of Software and Materials Table included in the Bidding Document.  If provided for in the Bid Data Sheet, the Procuring Entity may reserve the right to assign key System Software items to a particular category.\n\n\nBidder Qualification forms:  As required by ITB Clause\u00a06.1. \n\n\nForms for securing the bid:  If the BDS for ITB Clause\u00a017 (ITB Clause\u00a029 in the two-stage SBD) requires that bids be secured, the Procuring Entity should include the related form(s) in the Bidding Document, as provided in this Section of the SBD.  Depending on what type of security the BDS requires, one form (Bid-Securing Declaration), two forms (Bank Guarantee and Bid Bond), or all three forms, should be included.  Some of the variable fields (such as the duration of sanctions in case of the Bid-Securing Declaration) need to be pre-filled by the Procuring Entity.\n\n\nPerformance Security:  Pursuant to GCC Clause 13.3, the successful Bidder is required to provide the Performance Security within twenty-eight (28) days of notification of Contract award.\n\n\nAdvance Payment Security:  Pursuant to GCC Clause 13.2, the successful Bidder is required to provide a bank guarantee securing the Advance Payment, if the SCC related to GCC Clause 12.1 provides for an Advance Payment.\n\n\nInstallation and Operational Acceptance Certificates:  Recommended formats for these certificates are included in these SBD.  Unless the Procuring Entity has good reason to require procedures that differ from those recommended, or to require different wording in the certificates, the procedures and forms shall be included unchanged.  If the Procuring Entity wishes to amend the recommended procedures and/or certificates, it may propose alternatives for the approval of ZPPA before release of the Bidding Document to potential Bidders.\n\n\nChange Order Procedures and Forms:  Similar to the Installation and Operational Acceptance Certificates, the Change Estimate Proposal, Estimate Acceptance, Change Proposal, Change Order, and related Forms should be included in the Bidding Document unaltered.  If the Procuring Entity wishes to amend the recommended procedures and/or certificates, it may propose alternatives for the approval of ZPPA before release of the Bidding Document.\n\nNotes to Bidders on working with the Sample Forms\n\n\nThe Procuring Entity has prepared the forms in this section of the Bidding Documents to suit the specific requirements of the System being procured. In its bid, the Bidder must use these forms (or forms that present in the same sequence substantially the same information).  Bidders should not introduce changes without the Procuring Entity\u2019s prior written consent.  If the Bidder has a question regarding the meaning or appropriateness of the contents or format of the forms and/or the instructions contained in them, these questions should be brought to the Procuring Entity\u2019s attention as soon as possible during the bid clarification process, either at the pre-bid meeting or by addressing them to the Procuring Entity in writing pursuant to ITB Clause\u00a010.\n\n\nThe Procuring Entity has tried to provide explanatory text and instructions to help the Bidder prepare the forms accurately and completely.  The instructions that appear directly on the forms themselves are indicated by use of typographical aides such as italicized text within square brackets as is shown in the following example taken from the Bid Submission Form:\n\nDuly authorized to sign this bid for and on behalf of [name of Bidder]\nIn preparing its bid, the Bidder must ensure all such information is provided and that the typographical aides are removed.\n\n\nThe sample forms provide a standard set of documents that support the procurement process as it moves forward from the stage of bidding, through Contract formation and onto Contract performance.  The first set of forms must be completed and submitted as part of the bid prior to the deadline for bid submission.  These include: (i)\u00a0the Bid Submission Form; (ii) the Price Schedules; (iii) the Manufacturer\u2019s Authorizations and key Subcontractor agreements; (iv) the List of Proposed Subcontractors; (v)\u00a0the form(s) for securing the bid (if and as required); and other forms as found in sub-sections 1 through 4 of this Section VII of the Bidding Documents.\n\n\u00b7 Bid Submission Form: In addition to being the place where official confirmation of the bid price, the currency breakdown, the completion date(s), and other important Contract details are expressed, the Bid Submission Form is also used by the Bidder to confirm - in case adjudication applies in this Contract - its acceptance of the Procuring Entity\u2019s proposed Adjudicator, or to propose an alternative.  If the bid is being submitted on behalf of a Joint Venture, it is essential that the Bid Submission Form be signed by the partner in charge and that it be supported by the authorizations and power of attorney required pursuant to ITB Clause 6.2.  Given widespread concern about illegal use of licensed software, Bidders will be asked to certify in the Bid Submission Form that either the Software included in the bid was developed and is owned by the Bidder, or, if not, the Software is covered by valid licenses with the proprietor of the Software.\n\n\u00b7 Price Schedules: The prices quoted in the Price Schedules should constitute full and fair compensation for supply, installation, and achieving Operational Acceptance of the System as described in the Technical Requirements based on the Implementation Schedule, and the terms and conditions of the proposed Contract as set forth in the Bidding Documents.  Prices should be given for each line item provided in the Schedules, with costs carefully aggregated first at the Subsystem level and then for the entire System.  If the Price Schedules provide only a summary breakdown of items and components, or do not cover some items unique to the Bidder\u2019s specific technical solution, the Bidder may extend the Schedules to capture those items or components.  If supporting price and cost tables are needed for a full understanding of the bid, they should be included.\n\nArithmetical errors should be avoided.  If they occur, the Procuring Entity will correct them according to ITB Clause\u00a026.2 (ITB Clause\u00a038.2 in the two-stage SBD) without consulting the Bidder.  Major omissions, inconsistencies, or lack of substantiating detail can lead to rejection of a bid for commercial non-responsiveness. Presenting prices according to the breakdown prescribed in the Price Schedules is also essential for another reason.  If a bid does not separate prices in the prescribed way, and, as a result, the Procuring Entity cannot apply the domestic preference provision described in ITB Clause\u00a029 (ITB Clause\u00a041 in the two-stage SBD), if they are applicable in this bidding, the Bidder will lose the benefit of the preference. Once bids are opened, none of these problems can be rectified.  At that stage, Bidders are not permitted to change their bid prices to overcome errors or omissions.\n\n\u00b7 Manufacturer\u2019s Authorizations and written agreements by key Subcontractors: In accordance with ITB Clauses\u00a06.1\u00a0(b) and (c), a Bidder may be required to submit, as part of its bid, Manufacturer\u2019s Authorizations in the format provided in the Bidding Documents, and agreements by Subcontractors proposed for key services, for all items specified in the Bid Data Sheet.  There is no particular format (or sample form) for Subcontractor agreements.\n\n\u00b7 List of Proposed Subcontractors: In accordance with ITB Clause\u00a06.3, a Bidder must submit, as part of its bid, a list of proposed subcontracts for major items of Technologies, Goods, and/or Services.  The list should also include the names and places of registration of the Subcontractors proposed for each item and a summary of their qualifications.\n\n\u00b7 List of Software and Materials: In accordance with ITB Clause\u00a013.1\u00a0(e)\u00a0(vi) (ITB Clauses\u00a013.1\u00a0(c)\u00a0(vi) and 25.1\u00a0(e)\u00a0(vi) in the two-stage SBD), Bidders must submit, as part of their bids, lists of all the Software included in the bid assigned to one of the following categories: (A)\u00a0System, General-Purpose, or Application Software; or (B)\u00a0Standard or Custom Software.  Bidders must also submit a list of all Custom Materials.  If provided for in the Bid Data Sheet, the Procuring Entity may reserve the right to reassign certain key Software to a different category.\n\n\u00b7 Qualification information forms:  In accordance with ITB Clause\u00a06, the Procuring Entity will determine whether the Bidder is qualified to undertake the Contract.  This entails financial, technical as well as performance history criteria which are specified in the BDS for ITB Clause\u00a06.  The Bidder must provide the necessary information for the Procuring Entity to make this assessment through the forms in this sub-section.  The forms contain additional detailed instructions which the Bidder must follow.\n\n\u00b7 Securing the bid:  If the BDS for ITB Clause 17 (ITB Clause 29 in the two-stage SBD) requires that bids be secured, the Bidder shall do so in accordance with the type and details specified in the same ITB/BDS Clause, either using the form(s) included in these Sample Forms or using another form acceptable to the Procuring Entity.  If a Bidder wishes to use an alternative form, it should ensure that the revised format provides substantially the same protection as the standard format; failing that, the Bidder runs the risk of rejection for commercial non-responsiveness.\n\nBidders need not provide the Performance Security and Advance Payment Security with their bids.  Only the Bidder selected for award by the Procuring Entity will be required to provide these securities.\n\n\nThe following forms are to be completed and submitted by the successful Bidder following notification of award: (i)\u00a0Contract Agreement, with all Appendices; (ii)\u00a0Performance Security; and (iii)\u00a0Advance Payment Security.\n\n\u00b7 Contract Agreement:  In addition to specifying the parties and the Contract Price, the Contract Agreement is where the: (i)\u00a0Supplier Representative; (ii)\u00a0if applicable, agreed Adjudicator and his/her compensation; and (iii) the List of Approved Subcontractors are specified.  In addition, modifications to the successful Bidder\u2019s Bid Price Schedules are attached to the Agreement.  These contain corrections and adjustments to the Supplier\u2019s bid prices to correct errors, adjust the Contract Price to reflect \u2013 if applicable - any extensions to bid validity beyond the last day of original bid validity plus 56 days, etc.\n\n\u00b7 Performance Security:  Pursuant to GCC Clause 13.3, the successful Bidder is required to provide the Performance Security in the form contained in this section of these Bidding Documents and in the amount specified in accordance with the SCC.\n\n\u00b7 Advance Payment Security:  Pursuant to GCC Clause 13.2, the successful Bidder is required to provide a bank guarantee for the full amount of the Advance Payment - if an Advance Payment is specified in the SCC for GCC 12.1 - in the form contained in this section of these Bidding Documents or another form acceptable to the Procuring Entity.  If a Bidder wishes to propose a different Advance Payment Security form, it should submit a copy to the Procuring Entity promptly for review and confirmation of acceptability before the bid submission deadline.\n\n\nThe Procuring Entity and Supplier will use the following additional forms during Contract implementation to formalize or certify important Contract events: (i) the Installation and Operational Acceptance Certificates; and (ii) the various Change Order forms.  These and the procedures for their use during performance of the Contract are included in the Bidding Documents for the information of Bidders.\n\nTable of Sample Forms\n\n1851.

Price Schedule Forms\n\nNote:  in information systems procurement, the Contract Price (and payment schedule) should be linked as much as possible to achievement of operational capabilities, not just to the physical delivery of technology. \n\n2.1\nPreamble\n\nNote:\nProcuring Entitys should highlight any special requirements of the System and Contract in a Preamble to the Price Schedules.  The following is an example of one such preamble.\n\nGeneral\n\n1.\nThe Price Schedules are divided into separate Schedules as follows:\n\n2.2\nGrand Summary Cost Table\n\n2.3\nSupply and Installation Cost Summary Table\n\n2.4\nRecurrent Cost Summary Table\n\n2.5\nSupply and Installation Cost Sub-Table(s)\n\n2.6\nRecurrent Cost Sub-Tables(s)\n\n2.7\nCountry of Origin Code Table\n\n[Any other Schedules as appropriate]\n2.\nThe Schedules do not generally give a full description of the information technologies to be supplied, installed, and operationally accepted, or the Services to be performed under each item.  However, it is assumed that Bidders shall have read the Technical Requirements and other sections of these Bidding Documents to ascertain the full scope of the requirements associated with each item prior to filling in the rates and prices.  The quoted rates and prices shall be deemed to cover the full scope of these Technical Requirements, as well as overhead and profit.\n\n3.\nIf Bidders are unclear or uncertain as to the scope of any item, they shall seek clarification in accordance with the Instructions to Bidders in the Bidding Documents prior to submitting their bid.\n\nPricing\n\n4.\nPrices shall be filled in indelible ink, and any alterations necessary due to errors, etc., shall be initialed by the Bidder.  As specified in the Bid Data Sheet, prices shall be fixed and firm for the duration of the Contract.\n\n5.\nBid prices shall be quoted in the manner indicated and in the currencies specified in ITB Clauses\u00a014 and 15 (ITB Clauses 27 and 28 in the two-stage SBD).  Prices must correspond to items of the scope and quality defined in the Technical Requirements or elsewhere in these Bidding Documents.\n\n6.\nThe Bidder must exercise great care in preparing its calculations, since there is no opportunity to correct errors once the deadline for submission of bids has passed.  A single error in specifying a unit price can therefore change a Bidder\u2019s overall total bid price substantially, make the bid noncompetitive, or subject the Bidder to possible loss.  The Procuring Entity will correct any arithmetic error in accordance with the provisions of ITB Clause\u00a026.2 (ITB Clause\u00a038.2 in the two-stage SBD).\n\n7.\nPayments will be made to the Supplier in the currency or currencies indicated under each respective item.  As specified in ITB Clause\u00a015.1 (ITB Clause\u00a028.1 in the two-stage SBD), no more than three foreign currencies may be used.  The price of an item should be unique regardless of installation site.\n\n2.2\nGrand Summary Cost Table\n\n\t\n\t\n\t[\u00a0insert:  Local Currency\u00a0]\nPrice\n\t[\u00a0insert:  Foreign Currency A\u00a0] \nPrice\n\t[\u00a0insert:  Foreign Currency B\u00a0] \nPrice\n\t[\u00a0insert:  Foreign Currency C\u00a0] \nPrice\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t1.\n\tSupply and Installation Costs (from Supply and Installation Cost Summary Table)\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t2.\n\tRecurrent Costs (from Recurrent Cost Summary Table)\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t3.\n\tGrand Totals (to Bid Submission Form)\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tName of Bidder:\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tAuthorized Signature of Bidder:\n\t\n\t\n\n\n2.3\nSupply and Installation Cost Summary Table\nSystem or Subsystem number:  [\u00a0N/A\u00a0]  [\u00a0as necessary for supply, installation, and achieving Operational Acceptance of the System, specify items in the Table below, modifying, deleting, or expanding the sample line items and sample table entries as needed.\u00a0]\nCosts MUST reflect prices and rates quoted in accordance with ITB Clauses\u00a014 and 15 (ITB Clauses\u00a027 and 28 in the two-stage SBD).\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSupply & Installation Prices\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tLocally supplied items\n\tItems supplied from outside the Procuring Entity\u2019s Country\n\n\tLine Item No.\n\t\n\nSubsystem / Item\n\tSupply and Installation\nCost Sub-Table No.\n\t[\u00a0insert:  Local Currency\u00a0]\nPrice\n\t[\u00a0insert:  Local Currency\u00a0]\nPrice\n\t[\u00a0insert:  Foreign Currency A] Price\n\t[\u00a0insert:  Foreign Currency B] Price\n\t[\u00a0insert:  Foreign Currency C] Price\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t0\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t1.1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t1.2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t1.3\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t2.1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t2.2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tj\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tj.1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tj.2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tj.3\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t:\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tk\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tk.1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tk.2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tk.3\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t:\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tm\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tSUBTOTALS\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tTOTAL (To Grand Summary Table)\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nNote:\n- - indicates not applicable.  \u201c indicates repetition of table entry above.

Fletcher (Aug 10, 2011) \u2013 For submission to HOPs (July 28, 2011)\nSTANDARD PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTS\n\n\nStandard Request for Proposals\nTENDER FOR THE PROVISION OF CONSULTANCY SERVICES ON NETWORK SECURITY GAP ASSESSMENT \u2013 ZT/TI/TD/0040/2021\n\t\n\n\nNovember 2021\nForeword\n\n1. This Standard Request for Proposals (\u201cSRFP\u201d) has been prepared by the Zambia Public Procurement Authority (\u201cZPPA\u201d) and is based on the Master Procurement Document for Selection of Consultants (\u201cMaster Document\u201d). The Master Document was prepared by participating Multilateral Development Banks (\u201cMDBs\u201d) and reflects what are considered \u201cbest practices\u201d.\n\n2. This SRFP follows the structure and the provisions of the Master Document, except where specific considerations within the respective institutions have required a change. \n\n3. The text shown in Italics is \u201cNotes to the Client\u201d. It provides guidance to the entity in preparing a specific RFP. \u201cNotes to the Client\u201d should be deleted from the final RFP issued to the shortlisted Consultants.\n\n4. This SRFP can be used with different selection methods, including Quality and Cost-Based Selection (\u201cQCBS\u201d), Quality-Based Selection (\u201cQBS\u201d), Selection under a Fixed Budget (\u201cFBS\u201d), and Least-Cost Selection (\u201cLCS\u201d). When mandating the use of this SRFP on the implementing agency, however, primary consideration should be given to the complexity and value of the assignment.\n5. The use of this SRFP is not required for selections conducted under commercial practice, selection of individual consultants, and in the case of entering into an agreement with a UN agency in a format approved by Government. For Selection Based on Consultant\u2019s Qualifications (\u201cCQS\u201d) or under any selection method other than QCBS relevant elements of this SRFP may be used and further simplified for the purpose of a particular assignment.\n6. Before preparing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a specific assignment, the user must be familiar with the \u201cConsultants \u2018Guidelines\u201d, and must have chosen an appropriate method and the appropriate contract form. The SRFP includes two standard forms of contract: one for time-based assignments and the other for lump-sum assignments. The prefaces to these two contracts indicate the circumstances in which their use is most appropriate.  \n\nSUMMARY DESCRIPTION\n\nSTANDARD REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS\n\nPART I \u2013 SELECTION PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS\nSection 1: Letter of Invitation (LOI)\nThis Section is a template of a letter from the Client addressed to a shortlisted consulting firm inviting it to submit a proposal for a consulting assignment.

The Proposal will be the basis for negotiating and ultimately signing the Contract with the selected Consultant.\n2.3 The Consultants should familiarize themselves with the local conditions and take them into account in preparing their Proposals, including attending a pre-proposal conference if one is specified in the Data Sheet. Attending any such pre-proposal conference is optional and is at the Consultants\u2019 expense. \n2.4 The Client will timely provide, at no cost to the Consultants, the inputs, relevant project data, and reports required for the preparation of the Consultant\u2019s Proposal as specified in the Data Sheet.\n\n\t3. Conflict of Interest \n\n\t3.1 The Consultant is required to provide professional, objective, and impartial advice, at all times holding the Client\u2019s interests paramount, strictly avoiding conflicts with other assignments or its own corporate interests, and acting without any consideration for future work.\n3.2 The Consultant has an obligation to disclose to the Client any situation of actual or potential conflict that impacts its capacity to serve the best interest of its Client. Failure to disclose such situations may lead to the disqualification of the Consultant or the termination of its Contract and/or sanctions by ZPPA.\n3.2.1 Without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, and unless stated otherwise in the Data Sheet, the Consultant shall not be hired under the circumstances set forth below:\n\n\ta.  Conflicting activities\n\t(i)\nConflict between consulting activities and procurement of goods, works or non-consulting services: a firm that has been engaged by the Client to provide goods, works, or non-consulting services for a project shall be disqualified from providing consulting services resulting from or directly related to those goods, works, or non-consulting services. Conversely, a firm hired to provide consulting services for the preparation or implementation of a project shall be disqualified from subsequently providing goods or works or non-consulting services resulting from or directly related to the consulting services for such preparation or implementation. \n\n\tb.  Conflicting assignments\n\t(ii)\nConflict among consulting assignments: a Consultant (including its Experts and Sub-consultants) or any of its Affiliates shall not be hired for any assignment that, by its nature, may be in conflict with another assignment of the Consultant for the same or for another Client.\n\n\tc.

Unfair Competitive Advantage\n\t4.1 Fairness and transparency in the selection process require that the Consultants or their Affiliates competing for a specific assignment do not derive a competitive advantage from having provided consulting services related to the assignment in question. To that end, the Client shall indicate in the Data Sheet and make available to all shortlisted Consultants together with this RFP all information that would in that respect give such Consultant any unfair competitive advantage over competing Consultants.  \n\n\t5. Corrupt and Fraudulent Practices\n\t5.1 The Government requires compliance with its policy in regard to corrupt and fraudulent practices as set forth in Section 6. \n5.2 In further pursuance of this policy, Consultant shall permit and shall cause its agents, Experts, Sub-consultants, sub-contractors, services providers, or suppliers to permit the Government to inspect all accounts, records, and other documents relating to the submission of the Proposal and contract performance (in case of an award), and to have them audited by auditors appointed by the Government.\n\n\t6. Eligibility\n\t6.1 The Government permits consultants (individuals and firms, including Joint Ventures and their individual members) from all countries to offer consulting services for Government-financed projects.\n\n6.2 Furthermore, it is the Consultant\u2019s responsibility to ensure that its Experts, joint venture members, Sub-consultants, agents (declared or not), sub-contractors, service providers, suppliers and/or their employees meet the eligibility requirements as established by the Government. \n6.3 As an exception to the foregoing Clauses 6.1 and 6.2 above: \n\n\ta. Sanctions\n\t6.3.1 A firm or an individual sanctioned by ZPPA in accordance with Sections sixty-five, sixty-six and sixty-seven of the Public Procurement Act of 2008 and regulations 162 to 167 of the Public Procurement Regulations of 2011, shall be ineligible to be awarded a Government-financed contract, or to benefit from a Government-financed contract, financially or otherwise, during such period of time as ZPPA shall determine. The list of debarred firms and individuals is available at the electronic address specified in the Data Sheet. \n\n\tb. Prohibitions\n\t6.3.2 Firms and individuals of a country or goods manufactured in a country may be ineligible if so indicated in Section 5 (Eligible Countries) and: \n(a) \nas a matter of law or official regulations, the Government prohibits commercial relations with that country, provided that Cooperating Partners involved are satisfied that such exclusion does not preclude effective competition for the provision of Services required; or \n\n(b)\nby an act of compliance with a decision of the United Nations Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, the Government prohibits any import of goods from that country or any payments to any country, person, or entity in that country.\n\n\tc. Restrictions for Government-owned Enterprises\n\t6.3.3 A statutory corporation or body or company in which Government has a majority or controlling interest shall be eligible only if they meet the provisions of Section 34 of the Public Procurement Act of 2008.\nTo establish eligibility, the government-owned enterprise or institution should provide all relevant documents (including its charter) sufficient to demonstrate that it meets the provisions of Section 34(2) of the Public Procurement Act of 2008.\n\n\td. Restrictions for public employees\n\t6.3.4 Government officials and civil servants of Zambia are not eligible to be included as Experts in the Consultant\u2019s Proposal unless such engagement does not conflict with any employment or other laws, regulations, or policies of Zambia, and they:\n(i) are on leave of absence without pay, or have resigned or retired; \n(ii) are not being hired by the same agency they were working for before going on leave of absence without pay, resigning, or retiring \n(in case of resignation or retirement, for a period of at least 6 (six) months, or the period established by statutory provisions applying to civil servants or government employees in Zambia, whichever is longer. Experts who are employed by the government-owned universities, educational or research institutions are not eligible unless they have been full time employees of their institutions for a year or more prior to being included in Consultant\u2019s Proposal.; and  \n\n (iii) their hiring would not create a conflict of interest.\n\n\tB.  Preparation of Proposals\n\n\t7. General Considerations\n\t7.1 In preparing the Proposal, the Consultant is expected to examine the RFP in detail. Material deficiencies in providing the information requested in the RFP may result in rejection of the Proposal.\n\n\t8. Cost of Preparation of Proposal\n\t8.1 The Consultant shall bear all costs associated with the preparation and submission of its Proposal, and the Client shall not be responsible or liable for those costs, regardless of the conduct or outcome of the selection process. The Client is not bound to accept any proposal, and reserves the right to annul the selection process at any time prior to Contract award, without thereby incurring any liability to the Consultant.\n\n\t9. Language \n\t9.1 The Proposal, as well as all correspondence and documents relating to the Proposal exchanged between the Consultant and the Client, shall be written in English.\n\n\t10. Documents Comprising the Proposal\n\t10.1 The Proposal shall comprise the documents and forms listed in the Data Sheet.\n\n10.2 If specified in the Data Sheet, the Consultant shall include a statement of an undertaking of the Consultant to observe, in competing for and executing a contract, the Client country\u2019s laws against fraud and corruption (including bribery).\n\n10.3 The Consultant shall furnish information on commissions, gratuities, and fees, if any, paid or to be paid to agents or any other party relating to this Proposal and, if awarded, Contract execution, as requested in the Financial Proposal submission form (Section 4). \n\n\t11. Only One Proposal\n\t11.1 The Consultant (including the individual members of any Joint Venture) shall submit only one Proposal, either in its own name or as part of a Joint Venture in another Proposal. If a Consultant, including any Joint Venture member, submits or participates in more than one proposal, all such proposals shall be disqualified and rejected. This does not, however, preclude a Sub-consultant, or the Consultant\u2019s staff from participating as Key Experts and Non-Key Experts in more than one Proposal when circumstances justify and if stated in the Data Sheet.\n\n\t12. Proposal Validity\n\t12.1  The Data Sheet indicates the period during which the Consultant\u2019s Proposal must remain valid after the Proposal submission deadline.\n\n12.2  During this period, the Consultant shall maintain its original Proposal without any change, including the availability of the Key Experts, the proposed rates and the total price. \n\n12.3 If it is established that any Key Expert nominated in the Consultant\u2019s Proposal was not available at the time of Proposal submission or was included in the Proposal without his/her confirmation, such Proposal shall be disqualified and rejected for further evaluation, and may be subject to sanctions in accordance with Clause 5 of this ITC. \n\n\ta. Extension of Validity Period\n\t12.4 The Client will make its best effort to complete the negotiations within the proposal\u2019s validity period. However, should the need arise, the Client may request, in writing, all Consultants who submitted Proposals prior to the submission deadline to extend the Proposals\u2019 validity. \n\n12.5 If the Consultant agrees to extend the validity of its Proposal, it shall be done without any change in the original Proposal and with the confirmation of the availability of the Key Experts.\n\n12.6 The Consultant has the right to refuse to extend the validity of its Proposal in which case such Proposal will not be further evaluated.\n\n\tb. Substitution of Key Experts at Validity Extension \n\t12.7 If any of the Key Experts become unavailable for the extended validity period, the Consultant shall provide a written adequate justification and evidence satisfactory to the Client together with the substitution request. In such case, a replacement Key Expert shall have equal or better qualifications and experience than those of the originally proposed Key Expert. The technical evaluation score, however, will remain to be based on the evaluation of the CV of the original Key Expert.\n\n12.8 If the Consultant fails to provide a replacement Key Expert with equal or better qualifications, or if the provided reasons for the replacement or justification are unacceptable to the Client, such Proposal will be rejected.\n\n\tc. Sub-Contracting\n\t12.9 The Consultant shall not subcontract the whole of the Services.\n\n\t13. Clarification and Amendment of RFP \n\t13.1 The Consultant may request a clarification of any part of the RFP during the period indicated in the Data Sheet before the Proposals\u2019 submission deadline. Any request for clarification must be sent in writing, or by standard electronic means, to the Client\u2019s address indicated in the Data Sheet. The Client will respond in writing, or by standard electronic means, and will send written copies of the response (including an explanation of the query but without identifying its source) to all shortlisted Consultants. Should the Client deem it necessary to amend the RFP as a result of a clarification, it shall do so following the procedure described below: \n\n13.1.1 At any time before the proposal submission deadline, the Client may amend the RFP by issuing an amendment in writing or by standard electronic means. The amendment shall be sent to all shortlisted Consultants and will be binding on them. The shortlisted Consultants shall acknowledge receipt of all amendments in writing. \n13.1.2 If the amendment is substantial, the Client may extend the proposal submission deadline to give the shortlisted Consultants reasonable time to take an amendment into account in their Proposals. \n13.2  The Consultant may submit a modified Proposal or a modification to any part of it at any time prior to the proposal submission deadline. No modifications to the Technical or Financial Proposal shall be accepted after the deadline.\n\n\t14. Preparation of Proposals \u2013 Specific Considerations\n\t14.1 While preparing the Proposal, the Consultant must give particular attention to the following: \n\n14.1.1 If a shortlisted Consultant considers that it may enhance its expertise for the assignment by associating with other consultants in the form of a Joint Venture or as Sub-consultants, it may do so with either (a) non-shortlisted Consultant(s), or (b) shortlisted Consultants if permitted in the Data Sheet. In all such cases a shortlisted Consultant must obtain the written approval of the Client prior to the submission of the Proposal. When associating with non-shortlisted firms in the form of a joint venture or a sub-consultancy, the shortlisted Consultant shall be a lead member. If shortlisted Consultants associate with each other, any of them can be a lead member.  \n14.1.2 The Client may indicate in the Data Sheet the estimated Key Experts\u2019 time input (expressed in person-month) or the Client\u2019s estimated total cost of the assignment, but not both. This estimate is indicative and the Proposal shall be based on the Consultant\u2019s own estimates for the same. \n14.1.3 If stated in the Data Sheet, the Consultant shall include in its Proposal at least the same time input (in the same unit as indicated in the Data Sheet) of Key Experts, failing which the Financial Proposal will be adjusted for the purpose of comparison of proposals and decision for award in accordance with the procedure in the Data Sheet. \n14.1.4 For assignments under the Fixed-Budget selection method, the estimated Key Experts\u2019 time input is not disclosed. Total available budget, with an indication whether it is inclusive or exclusive of taxes, is given in the Data Sheet, and the Financial Proposal shall not exceed this budget.\n\n\t15. Technical Proposal Format and Content\n\t15.1 The Technical Proposal shall not include any financial information. A Technical Proposal containing material financial information shall be declared non-responsive. \n\n15.1.1 Consultant shall not propose alternative Key Experts. Only one CV shall be submitted for each Key Expert position. Failure to comply with this requirement will make the Proposal non-responsive.\n15.2 Depending on the nature of the assignment, the Consultant is required to submit a Full Technical Proposal (FTP), or a Simplified Technical Proposal (STP) as indicated in the Data Sheet and using the Standard Forms provided in Section 3 of the RFP. \n\n\t16. Financial Proposal\n\t16.1  The Financial Proposal shall be prepared using the    Standard Forms provided in Section 4 of the RFP. It shall list all costs associated with the assignment, including (a) remuneration for Key Experts and Non-Key Experts, (b) reimbursable expenses indicated in the Data Sheet. \n\n\ta. Price Adjustment \n\t16.2  For assignments with a duration exceeding 18 months, a price adjustment provision for foreign and/or local inflation for remuneration rates applies if so stated in the Data Sheet.\n\n\tb. Taxes\n\t16.3  The Consultant and its Sub-consultants and Experts are responsible for meeting all tax liabilities arising out of the Contract unless stated otherwise in the Data Sheet. Information on taxes in Zambia is provided in the Data Sheet.\n\n\tc. Currency of Proposal \n\t16.4  The Consultant may express the price for its Services in the currency or currencies as stated in the Data Sheet. If indicated in the Data Sheet, the portion of the price representing local cost shall be stated in the national currency. \n\n\td. Currency of Payment\n\t16.5  Payment under the Contract shall be made in the currency or currencies in which the payment is requested in the Proposal.\n\n\tC.  Submission, Opening and Evaluation\n\n\t17. Submission, Sealing, and Marking of Proposals\n\t17.1 The Consultant shall submit a signed and complete Proposal comprising the documents and forms in accordance with Clause 10 (Documents Comprising Proposal). The submission can be done by mail or by hand. If specified in the Data Sheet, the Consultant has the option of submitting its Proposals electronically.\n\n17.2 An authorized representative of the Consultant shall sign the original submission letters in the required format for both the Technical Proposal and, if applicable, the Financial Proposal and shall initial all pages of both. The authorization shall be in the form of a written power of attorney attached to the Technical Proposal.\n\n17.2.1 A Proposal submitted by a Joint Venture shall be signed by all members so as to be legally binding on all members, or by an authorized representative who has a written power of attorney signed by each member\u2019s authorized representative.\n17.3 Any modifications, revisions, interlineations, erasures, or overwriting shall be valid only if they are signed or initialed by the person signing the Proposal.\n\n17.4 The signed Proposal shall be marked \u201cOriginal\u201d, and its copies marked \u201cCopy\u201d as appropriate. The number of copies is indicated in the Data Sheet. All copies shall be made from the signed original. If there are discrepancies between the original and the copies, the original shall prevail.\n17.5 The original and all the copies of the Technical Proposal shall be placed inside of a sealed envelope clearly marked \u201cTechnical Proposal\u201d, \u201c[Name of the Assignment] \u201c, reference number, name and address of the Consultant, and with a warning \u201cDo Not Open until [insert the date and the time of the Technical Proposal submission deadline].\u201d \n17.6 Similarly, the original Financial Proposal (if required for the applicable selection method) shall be placed inside of a sealed envelope clearly marked \u201cFinancial Proposal\u201d followed by the name of the assignment, reference number, name and address of the Consultant, and with a warning \u201cDo Not Open With The Technical Proposal.\u201d \n17.7 The sealed envelopes containing the Technical and Financial Proposals shall be placed into one outer envelope and sealed. This outer envelope shall bear the submission address, RFP reference number, the name of the assignment, Consultant\u2019s name and the address, and shall be clearly marked \u201cDo Not Open Before [insert the time and date of the submission deadline indicated in the Data Sheet]\u201d.\n17.8 If the envelopes and packages with the Proposal are not sealed and marked as required, the Client will assume no responsibility for the misplacement, loss, or premature opening of the Proposal. \n17.9 The Proposal or its modifications must be sent to the address indicated in the Data Sheet and received by the Client no later than the deadline indicated in the Data Sheet, or any extension to this deadline. Any Proposal or its modification received by the Client after the deadline shall be declared late and rejected, and promptly returned unopened.\n\n\t18. Confidentiality\n\t18.1 From the time the Proposals are opened to the time the Contract is awarded, the Consultant should not contact the Client on any matter related to its Technical and/or Financial Proposal. Information relating to the evaluation of Proposals and award recommendations shall not be disclosed to the Consultants who submitted the Proposals or to any other party not officially concerned with the process, until the publication of the Contract award information.\n18.2 Any attempt by shortlisted Consultants or anyone on behalf of the Consultant to influence improperly the Client in the evaluation of the Proposals or Contract award decisions may result in the rejection of its Proposal, and may be subject to the application of prevailing sanctions procedures.\n18.3 Notwithstanding the above provisions, from the time of the Proposals\u2019 opening to the time of Contract award publication, if a Consultant wishes to contact the Client or ZPPA on any matter related to the selection process, it should do so only in writing.\n\n\t19. Opening of Technical Proposals\n\t19.1  The Client\u2019s evaluation committee shall conduct the opening of the Technical Proposals in the presence of the shortlisted Consultants\u2019 authorized representatives who choose to attend (in person, or online if this option is offered in the Data Sheet). The opening date, time and the address are stated in the Data Sheet. The envelopes with the Financial Proposal shall remain sealed and shall be securely stored with a reputable public auditor or independent authority until they are opened in accordance with Clause 23 of the ITC. \n\n19.2 At the opening of the Technical Proposals the following shall be read out: (i) the name and the country of the Consultant or, in case of a Joint Venture, the name of the Joint Venture, the name of the lead member and the names and the countries of all members; (ii) the presence or absence of a duly sealed envelope with the Financial Proposal; (iii) any modifications to the Proposal submitted prior to proposal submission deadline; and (iv) any other information deemed appropriate or as indicated in the Data Sheet.\n\n\t20. Proposals Evaluation\n\t20.1 Subject to provision of Clause 15.1 of the ITC, the evaluators of the Technical Proposals shall have no access to the Financial Proposals until the technical evaluation is concluded and approved. \n20.2 The Consultant is not permitted to alter or modify its Proposal in any way after the proposal submission deadline except as permitted under Clause 12.7 of this ITC. While evaluating the Proposals, the Client will conduct the evaluation solely on the basis of the submitted Technical and Financial Proposals. \n\n\t21. Evaluation of Technical Proposals\n\t21.1 The Client\u2019s evaluation committee shall evaluate the Technical Proposals on the basis of their responsiveness to the Terms of Reference and the RFP, applying the evaluation criteria, sub-criteria, and point system specified in the Data Sheet. Each responsive Proposal will be given a technical score. A Proposal shall be rejected at this stage if it does not respond to important aspects of the RFP or if it fails to achieve the minimum technical score indicated in the Data Sheet.\n\n\n\t22. Financial Proposals for QBS\n\t22.1   Following the ranking of the Technical Proposals, when the selection is based on quality only (QBS), the top-ranked Consultant is invited to negotiate the Contract.\n22.2 If Financial Proposals were invited together with the Technical Proposals, only the Financial Proposal of the technically top-ranked Consultant is opened by the Client\u2019s evaluation committee. All other Financial Proposals are returned unopened after the Contract negotiations are successfully concluded and the Contract is signed.\n\n\t23. Public Opening of Financial Proposals (for QCBS, FBS, and LCS methods)\n\t23.1 After the technical evaluation is completed and has been approved, the Client shall notify those Consultants whose Proposals were considered non-responsive to the RFP and TOR or did not meet the minimum qualifying technical score (and shall provide information relating to  the Consultant\u2019s overall technical score, as well as scores obtained for each criterion and sub-criterion)  that their Financial Proposals will be returned unopened after completing the selection process and Contract signing. The Client shall simultaneously notify in writing those Consultants that have achieved the minimum overall technical score and inform them of the date, time and location for the opening of the Financial Proposals. The opening date should allow the Consultants sufficient time to make arrangements for attending the opening. The Consultant\u2019s attendance at the opening of the Financial Proposals (in person, or online if such option is indicated in the Data Sheet) is optional and is at the Consultant\u2019s choice. \n23.2  The Financial Proposals shall be opened by the Client\u2019s evaluation committee in the presence of the representatives of those Consultants whose proposals have passed the minimum technical score. At the opening, the names of the Consultants, and the overall technical scores, including the break-down by criterion, shall be read aloud. The Financial Proposals will then be inspected to confirm that they have remained sealed and unopened. These Financial Proposals shall be then opened, and the total prices read aloud and recorded. Copies of the record shall be sent to all Consultants who submitted Proposals. \n\n\t24. Correction of Errors\n\t24.1 Activities and items described in the Technical Proposal but not priced in the Financial Proposal, shall be assumed to be included in the prices of other activities or items, and no corrections are made to the Financial Proposal.\n\n\ta. Time-Based Contracts\n\n\t24.1.1 If a Time-Based contract form is included in the RFP, the Client\u2019s evaluation committee will (a) correct any computational or arithmetical errors, and (b) adjust the prices if they fail to reflect all inputs included for the respective activities or items in the Technical Proposal. In case of discrepancy between (i) a partial amount (sub-total) and the total amount, or (ii) between the amount derived by multiplication of unit price with quantity and the total price, or (iii) between words and figures, the former will prevail. In case of discrepancy between the Technical and Financial Proposals in indicating quantities of input, the Technical Proposal prevails and the Client\u2019s evaluation committee shall correct the quantification indicated in the Financial Proposal so as to make it consistent with that indicated in the Technical Proposal, apply the relevant unit price included in the Financial Proposal to the corrected quantity, and correct the total Proposal cost.\n\n\tb. Lump-Sum Contracts\n\n\n\t24.2   If a Lump-Sum contract form is included in the RFP, the Consultant is deemed to have included all prices in the Financial Proposal, so neither arithmetical corrections nor price adjustments shall be made. The total price, net of taxes understood as per Clause ITC 25 below, specified in the Financial Proposal (Form FIN-1) shall be considered as the offered price.\n\n\t25. Taxes\n\t25.1 The Client\u2019s evaluation of the Consultant\u2019s Financial Proposal shall exclude taxes and duties in Zambia in accordance with the instructions in the Data Sheet.\n\n\t26. Conversion to Single Currency\n\t26.1 For the evaluation purposes, prices shall be converted to a single currency using the selling rates of exchange, source and date indicated in the Data Sheet.\n\n\t27. Combined Quality and Cost Evaluation\n\t\n\n\ta. Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)\n\n\t27.1 In the case of QCBS, the total score is calculated by weighting the technical and financial scores and adding them as per the formula and instructions in the Data Sheet. The Consultant achieving the highest combined technical and financial score will be invited for negotiations.\n\n\tb. Fixed-Budget Selection (FBS)\n\t27.2 In the case of FBS, those Proposals that exceed the budget indicated in Clause 14.1.4 of the Data Sheet shall be rejected.\n27.3 The Client will select the Consultant that submitted the highest-ranked Technical Proposal that does not exceed the budget indicated in the RFP, and invite such Consultant to negotiate the Contract.\n\n\tc. Least-Cost Selection\n\t27.4 In the case of Least-Cost Selection (LCS), the Client will select the Consultant with the lowest evaluated total price among those consultants that achieved the minimum technical score, and invite such Consultant to negotiate the Contract.\n\n\tD.  Negotiations and Award\n\n\t28. Negotiations\n\t28.1 The negotiations will be held at the date and address indicated in the Data Sheet with the Consultant\u2019s representative(s) who must have written power of attorney to negotiate and sign a Contract on behalf of the Consultant. \n28.2 The Client shall prepare minutes of negotiations that are signed by the Client and the Consultant\u2019s authorized representative.\n\n\ta. Availability of Key Experts\n\t28.3 The invited Consultant shall confirm the availability of all Key Experts included in the Proposal as a pre-requisite to the negotiations, or, if applicable, a replacement in accordance with Clause 12 of the ITC. Failure to confirm the Key Experts\u2019 availability may result in the rejection of the Consultant\u2019s Proposal and the Client proceeding to negotiate the Contract with the next-ranked Consultant. \n\n28.4 Notwithstanding the above, the substitution of Key Experts at the negotiations may be considered if due solely to circumstances outside the reasonable control of and not foreseeable by the Consultant, including but not limited to death or medical incapacity. In such case, the Consultant shall offer a substitute Key Expert within the period of time specified in the letter of invitation to negotiate the Contract, who shall have equivalent or better qualifications and experience than the original candidate.\n\n\tb. Technical negotiations\n\t28.5 The negotiations include discussions of the Terms of Reference (TORs), the proposed methodology, the Client\u2019s inputs, the special conditions of the Contract, and finalizing the \u201cDescription of Services\u201d part of the Contract. These discussions shall not substantially alter the original scope of services under the TOR or the terms of the contract, lest the quality of the final product, its price, or the relevance of the initial evaluation be affected. \n\n\tc. Financial negotiations\n\n\t28.6  The negotiations include the clarification of the Consultant\u2019s tax liability in Zambia and how it should be reflected in the Contract. \n\n28.7 If the selection method included cost as a factor in the evaluation, the total price stated in the Financial Proposal for a Lump-Sum contract shall not be negotiated. \n28.8 In the case of a Time-Based contract, unit rates negotiations shall not take place, except when the offered Key Experts and Non-Key Experts\u2019 remuneration rates are much higher than the typically charged rates by consultants in similar contracts. In such case, the Client may ask for clarifications and, if the fees are very high, ask to change the rates after consultation with ZPPA.\nThe format for (i) providing information on remuneration rates in the case of Quality Based Selection; and (ii) clarifying remuneration rates\u2019 structure under Clause 28.8 above, is provided in Appendix A to the Financial Form FIN-3: Financial Negotiations \u2013 Breakdown of Remuneration Rates.\n\n\t29. Conclusion of Negotiations\n\t29.1  The negotiations are concluded with a review of the finalized draft Contract, which then shall be initialed by the Client and the Consultant\u2019s authorized representative. \n\n29.2 If the negotiations fail, the Client shall inform the Consultant in writing of all pending issues and disagreements and provide a final opportunity to the Consultant to respond. If disagreement persists, the Client shall terminate the negotiations informing the Consultant of the reasons for doing so. After having obtained approval, the Client will invite the next-ranked Consultant to negotiate a Contract. Once the Client commences negotiations with the next-ranked Consultant, the Client shall not reopen the earlier negotiations. \n\n\t30. Award of Contract\n\t30.1 After completing the negotiations, the Client shall obtain approval to the negotiated draft Contract, if applicable; sign the Contract; publish the award information as per the instructions in the Data Sheet; and promptly notify the other shortlisted Consultants.\n30.2 The Consultant is expected to commence the assignment on the date and at the location specified in the Data Sheet.\n\n\nInstructions to Consultants\n\nE.

Financial Negotiations - Breakdown of Remuneration Rates\n\n1. Review of Remuneration Rates\n1.1. The remuneration rates are made up of salary or a base fee, social costs, overheads, profit, and any premium or allowance that may be paid for assignments away from headquarters or a home office.  An attached Sample Form can be used to provide a breakdown of rates. \n1.2. If the RFP requests submission of a technical proposal only, the Sample Form is used by the selected Consultant to prepare for the negotiations of the Contract. If the RFP requests submission of the financial proposal, the Sample Form shall be completed and attached to the Financial Form-3.  Agreed (at the negotiations) breakdown sheets shall form part of the negotiated Contract and included in its Appendix D or C. \n1.3. At the negotiations the firm shall be prepared to disclose its audited financial statements for the last three years, to substantiate its rates, and accept that its proposed rates and other financial matters are subject to scrutiny.  The Client is charged with the custody of government funds and is expected to exercise prudence in the expenditure of these funds.  \n1.4. Rate details are discussed below:\n\n(i) Salary is the gross regular cash salary or fee paid to the individual in the firm\u2019s home office.  It shall not contain any premium for work away from headquarters or bonus (except where these are included by law or government regulations).\n(ii) Bonuses are normally paid out of profits.  To avoid double counting, any bonuses shall not normally be included in the \u201cSalary\u201d and should be shown separately.  Where the Consultant\u2019s accounting system is such that the percentages of social costs and overheads are based on total revenue, including bonuses, those percentages shall be adjusted downward accordingly.  Where national policy requires that 13 months\u2019 pay be given for 12 months\u2019 work, the profit element need not be adjusted downward.  Any discussions on bonuses shall be supported by audited documentation, which shall be treated as confidential.\n(iii) Social Charges are the costs of non-monetary benefits and may include, inter alia, social security (including pension, medical, and life insurance costs) and the cost of a paid sick and/or annual leave.  In this regard, a paid leave during public holidays or an annual leave taken during an assignment if no Expert\u2019s replacement has been provided is not considered social charges.  \n(iv) Cost of Leave. The principles of calculating the cost of total days leave per annum as a percentage of basic salary is normally calculated as follows:\n\n\nLeave cost as percentage of salary =  \n\n\nWhere w = weekends, ph = public holidays, v = vacation, and s = sick leave.\n\nPlease note that leave can be considered as a social cost only if the Client is not charged for the leave taken.\n(v) Overheads are the Consultant\u2019s business costs that are not directly related to the execution of the assignment and shall not be reimbursed as separate items under the Contract. Typical items are home office costs (non-billable time, time of senior Consultant\u2019s staff monitoring the project, rent of headquarters\u2019 office, support staff, research, staff training, marketing, etc.), the cost of Consultant\u2019s personnel not currently employed on revenue-earning projects, taxes on business activities, and business promotion costs. During negotiations, audited financial statements, certified as correct by an independent auditor and supporting the last three years\u2019 overheads, shall be available for discussion, together with detailed lists of items making up the overheads and the percentage by which each relates to basic salary.  The Client does not accept an add-on margin for social charges, overhead expenses, etc. for Experts who are not permanent employees of the Consultant.  In such case, the Consultant shall be entitled only to administrative costs and a fee on the monthly payments charged for sub-contracted Experts.\n(vi) Profit is normally based on the sum of the Salary, Social costs, and Overheads.  If any bonuses paid on a regular basis are listed, a corresponding reduction shall be made in the profit amount. Profit shall not be allowed on travel or any other reimbursable expenses.\n(vii) Away from Home Office Allowance or Premium or Subsistence Allowances. Some Consultants pay allowances to Experts working away from headquarters or outside of the home office.  Such allowances are calculated as a percentage of salary (or a fee) and shall not draw overheads or profit.  Sometimes, by law, such allowances may draw social costs.  In this case, the amount of this social cost shall still be shown under social costs, with the net allowance shown separately.\n\nUNDP standard rates for the particular country may be used as reference to determine subsistence allowances. \nSample Form\nConsultant:\nCountry:\n\nAssignment:\nDate:\n\nConsultant\u2019s Representations Regarding Costs and Charges\n\nWe hereby confirm that:\n\n(a)\nthe basic fees indicated in the attached table are taken from the firm\u2019s payroll records and reflect the current rates of the Experts listed which have not been raised other than within the normal annual pay increase policy as applied to all the Consultant\u2019s Experts;\n\n(b)\nattached are true copies of the latest pay slips of the Experts listed;\n\n(c)\nthe away- from- home office allowances indicated below are those that the Consultant has agreed to pay for this assignment to the Experts listed;\n\n(d)\nthe factors listed in the attached table for social charges and overhead are based on the firm\u2019s average cost experiences for the latest three years as represented by the firm\u2019s financial statements; and\n\n(e)\nsaid factors for overhead and social charges do not include any bonuses or other means of profit-sharing.\n\n[Name of Consultant]\nSignature of Authorized Representative\nDate\n\nName:  \n\nTitle:  \n\nConsultant\u2019s Representations Regarding Costs and Charges\n\n(Model Form I)\n\n(Expressed in {insert name of currency*})\n\n\tPersonnel\n\t1\n\t2\n\t3\n\t4\n\t5\n\t6\n\t7\n\t8\n\n\tName\n\tPosition\n\tBasic Remuneration Rate  per Working Month/Day/Year\n\tSocial Charges1\n\tOverhead1\n\tSubtotal\n\tProfit2\n\tAway from Home Office Allowance\n\tProposed Fixed Rate per Working Month/Day/Hour\n\tProposed Fixed Rate per Working Month/Day/Hour1\n\n\tHome Office\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tClient\u2019s Country\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n{* If more than one currency is used, use additional table(s), one for each currency}\n1.\nExpressed as percentage of 1\n\n2.\nExpressed as percentage of 4\nFORM FIN-4 BREAKDOWN of Reimbursable Expenses\nWhen used for Lump-Sum contract assignment, information to be provided in this Form shall only be used to demonstrate the basis for calculation of the Contract ceiling amount, to calculate applicable taxes at contract negotiations and, if needed, to establish payments to the Consultant for possible additional services requested by the Client.

Conditions of Contract and Contract Forms\nForeword\n\n1. Part II includes two types of standard Contract forms for Consulting Services (a Time-Based Contract and a Lump-Sum Contract) that are based on the contract forms included in the harmonized Standard Request for Proposals (Master Document for Selection of Consultants prepared by participating Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).\n\n2. Time-Based Contract. This type of contract is appropriate when it is difficult to define or fix the scope and the duration of the services, either because they are related to activities carried out by others for which the completion period may vary, or because the input of the consultants required for attaining the objectives of the assignment is difficult to assess. In time-based contracts the Consultant provides services on a timed basis according to quality specifications, and Consultant\u2019s remuneration is determined on the basis of the time actually spent by the Consultant in carrying out the Services and is based on (i) agreed upon unit rates for the Consultant\u2019s experts multiplied by the actual time spent by the experts in executing the assignment, and (ii) reimbursable expenses using actual expenses and/or agreed unit prices.  This type of contract requires the Client to closely supervise the Consultant and to be involved in the daily execution of the assignment.\n3. Lump-Sum Contract. This type of contract is used mainly for assignments in which the scope and the duration of the Services and the required output of the Consultant are clearly defined. Payments are linked to outputs (deliverables) such as reports, drawings, bill of quantities, bidding documents, or software programs. Lump-sum contracts are easier to administer because they operate on the principle of a fixed price for a fixed scope, and payments are due on clearly specified outputs and milestones. Nevertheless, quality control of the Consultant\u2019s outputs by the Client is paramount. \n4. The templates are designed for use in assignments with consulting firms and shall not be used for contracting of individual experts. These standard Contract forms are to be used for complex and/or large value assignments, and/or for contracts for which this SRFP is deemed to be suitably appropriate by the Procuring Entity.\nLump-Sum Form of Contract\n\nSTANDARD FORM OF CONTRACT\n\nConsultant\u2019s Services\n\nLump-Sum\n\nContents\n1PART I\n\n\n1Section 1.

Preparation of Bids\n\n\t8.\nLanguage of Bid\n\t8.1\nThe bid prepared by the Bidder, as well as all correspondence and documents relating to the bid exchanged by the Bidder and the Purchaser shall be written in the language specified in the Bid Data Sheet.  Supporting documents and printed literature furnished by the Bidder may be in another language provided they are accompanied by an accurate translation of the relevant passages in the language specified in the Bid Data Sheet, in which case, for purposes of interpretation of the Bid, the translation shall govern.\n\n\n\n\t9.\nDocuments Constituting the Bid\n\t9.1\nThe bid prepared by the Bidder shall comprise the following components:\n\n(a)\na Bid Form and a Price Schedule completed in accordance with ITB Clauses 10, 11, and 12;\n\n(b)\ndocumentary evidence established in accordance with ITB Clause 13 that the Bidder is eligible to bid and is qualified to perform the contract if its bid is accepted;\n\n(c)\ndocumentary evidence established in accordance with ITB Clause 14 that the goods and ancillary services to be supplied by the Bidder are eligible goods and services and conform to the bidding documents; and\n\n(d)\nBid security furnished in accordance with ITB Clause 15.\n\n\n\n\t10.\nBid Form\n\n\n\t10.1\nThe Bidder shall complete the Bid Form and the appropriate Price Schedule furnished in the bidding documents, indicating the goods to be supplied, a brief description of the goods, and their country of origin, quantity, and prices.\n\n10.2\nFor the purpose of granting a margin of domestic preference, bids will be classified in one of three groups, as follows:\n\n(a)\nGroup A:  Bids offering goods manufactured in the Purchaser\u2019s country, for which (i) labor, raw materials, and components from within the Purchaser\u2019s country account for more than thirty (30) percent of the EXW price; and (ii) the production facility in which they will be manufactured or assembled has been engaged in manufacturing or assembling such goods at least since the date of bid submission.\n\n(b)\nGroup B:  All other bids offering goods from within the country of the Purchaser.\n\n(c)\nGroup C:  Bids offering goods of foreign origin to be imported by the Purchaser directly or through the Supplier\u2019s local Agent.\n\n10.3\nTo facilitate this classification by the Purchaser, the Bidder shall complete whichever version of the Price Schedule furnished in the bidding documents is appropriate provided, however, that the completion of an incorrect version of the Price Schedule by the Bidder will not result in rejection of its bid, but merely in the Purchaser\u2019s reclassification of the bid into its appropriate bid group.\n\n\n\n\t11.\nBid Prices\n\t11.1\nThe Bidder shall indicate on the appropriate Price Schedule the unit prices (where applicable) and total bid price of the goods it proposes to supply under the contract.\n\n11.2\nPrices indicated on the Price Schedule shall be entered separately in the following manner:\n\n(a)\nFor goods offered from within the Purchaser\u2019s country:\n\n(i)\nthe price of the goods quoted EXW (ex works, ex factory, ex warehouse, ex showroom, or off-the-shelf, as applicable), including all customs duties and sales and other taxes already paid or payable:\n\n(A)\non the components and raw material used in the manufacture or assembly of goods quoted ex works or ex-factory;\n\nor\n\n(B)\non the previously imported goods of foreign origin quoted ex warehouse, ex showroom, or off-the-shelf.\n\n(ii)\nany Purchaser country sales and other taxes which will be payable on the goods if the contract is awarded.\n\n(iii)\nthe price for inland transportation, insurance, and other local costs incidental to delivery of the goods to their final destination, if specified in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n(iv)\nthe price of other (incidental) services, if any, listed in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n(b)\nFor goods offered from abroad:\n\n(i)\nthe price of the goods shall be quoted CIF named port of destination, or CIP border point, or CIP named place of destination, in the Purchaser\u2019s country, as specified in the Bid Data Sheet.  In quoting the price, the Bidder shall be free to use transportation through carriers registered in any eligible countries.  Similarly, the Bidder may obtain insurance services from any eligible source country.\n\n(ii)\nthe price of the goods quoted FOB port of shipment (or FCA, as the case may be), if specified in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n(iii)\nthe price of goods quoted CFR port of destination (or CPT as the case may be), if specified in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n(iv)\nthe price for inland transportation, insurance, and other local costs incidental to delivery of the goods from the port of entry to their final destination, if specified in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n(v)\nthe price of other (incidental) services, if any, listed in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n11.3\nThe terms EXW, CIF, CIP, etc., shall be governed by the rules prescribed in the current edition of Incoterms published by the International Chamber of Commerce, Paris.\n\n11.4\nThe Bidder\u2019s separation of price components in accordance with ITB Clause 11.2 above will be solely for the purpose of facilitating the comparison of bids by the Purchaser and will not in any way limit the Purchaser\u2019s right to contract on any of the terms offered.\n\n11.5\nPrices quoted by the Bidder shall be fixed during the Bidder\u2019s performance of the contract and not subject to variation on any account, unless otherwise specified in the Bid Data Sheet.  A bid submitted with an adjustable price quotation will be treated as non-responsive and will be rejected, pursuant to ITB Clause 24.  If, however, in accordance with the Bid Data Sheet, prices quoted by the Bidder shall be subject to adjustment during the performance of the contract, a bid submitted with a fixed price quotation will not be rejected, but the price adjustment would be treated as zero.\n\n\n\n\t12.\nBid Currencies\n\t12.1\nPrices shall be quoted in the following currencies:\n\n(a)\nFor goods and services that the Bidder will supply from within the Purchaser\u2019s country, the prices shall be quoted in the currency of the Purchaser\u2019s country, unless otherwise specified in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n(b)\nFor goods and services that the Bidder will supply from outside the Purchaser\u2019s country, the prices shall be quoted in any currency of a Bank member country.  If the Bidder wishes to be paid in a combination of amounts in different currencies, it may quote its price accordingly but use no more than three foreign currencies.   \n\n\n\n\t13.\nDocuments Establishing Bidder\u2019s Eligibility and Qualification\n\t13.1\nPursuant to ITB Clause 9, the Bidder shall furnish, as part of its bid, documents establishing the Bidder\u2019s eligibility to bid and its qualifications to perform the contract if its bid is accepted.\n\n13.2\nThe documentary evidence of the Bidder\u2019s eligibility to bid shall establish to the Purchaser\u2019s satisfaction that the Bidder, at the time of submission of its bid, is from an eligible country as defined under ITB Clause 2.\n\n13.3\nThe documentary evidence of the Bidder\u2019s qualifications to perform the contract if its bid is accepted shall establish to the Purchaser\u2019s satisfaction:\n\n(a)\nthat, in the case of a Bidder offering to supply goods under the contract which the Bidder did not manufacture or otherwise produce, the Bidder has been duly authorized by the goods\u2019 Manufacturer or producer to supply the goods in the Purchaser\u2019s country;\n\n(b) that the Bidder has the financial, technical, and production capability necessary to perform the contract;\n\n(c) that, in the case of a Bidder not doing business within the Purchaser\u2019s country, the Bidder is or will be (if awarded the contract) represented by an Agent in that country equipped and able to carry out the Supplier\u2019s maintenance, repair, and spare parts\u2011stocking obligations prescribed in the Conditions of Contract and/or Technical Specifications; and\n\n(d) That the Bidder meets the qualification criteria listed in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n(e) Bidder should attach proof of similar goods supplied\n(f) Bidder to attach the Certificate of Registration or Incorporation;\n\n(g) Bidder to attach the current Tax Clearance Certificate\n\n\n\n\t14.\nDocuments Establishing Goods\u2019 Eligibility and Conformity to Bidding Documents\n\t14.1\nPursuant to ITB Clause 9, the Bidder shall furnish, as part of its bid, documents establishing the eligibility and conformity to the bidding documents of all goods and services which the Bidder proposes to supply under the contract.\n\n14.2\nThe documentary evidence of the eligibility of the goods and services shall consist of a statement in the Price Schedule of the country of origin of the goods and services offered which shall be confirmed by a certificate of origin issued at the time of shipment.\n\n14.3\nThe documentary evidence of conformity of the goods and services to the bidding documents may be in the form of literature, drawings, and data, and shall consist of:\n\n(a)\na detailed description of the essential technical and performance characteristics of the goods;\n\n(b)\na list giving full particulars, including available sources and current prices of spare parts, special tools, etc., necessary for the proper and continuing functioning of the goods for a period to be specified in the Bid Data Sheet, following commencement of the use of the goods by the Purchaser; and\n\n(c)\nAn item-by-item commentary on the Purchaser\u2019s Technical Specifications demonstrating substantial responsiveness of the goods and services to those specifications, or a statement of deviations and exceptions to the provisions of the Technical Specifications.\n\n14.4\nFor purposes of the commentary to be furnished pursuant to ITB Clause 14.3(c) above, the Bidder shall note that standards for workmanship, material, and equipment, as well as references to brand names or catalogue numbers designated by the Purchaser in its Technical Specifications, are intended to be descriptive only and not restrictive.  The Bidder may substitute alternative standards, brand names, and/or catalogue numbers in its bid, provided that it demonstrates to the Purchaser\u2019s satisfaction that the substitutions ensure substantial equivalence to those designated in the Technical Specifications.\n\n\n\n\t15.\nBid Security\n\t15.1\nPursuant to ITB Clause 9, the Bidder shall furnish, as part of its bid, a bid security in the amount specified in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n15.2\nThe bid security is required to protect the Purchaser against the risk of Bidder\u2019s conduct which would warrant the security\u2019s forfeiture, pursuant to ITB Clause 15.7.\n\n15.3\nThe bid security shall be denominated in the currency of the bid or in another freely convertible currency, and shall be in one of the following forms:\n\n(a)\na bank guarantee, a bid bond or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a reputable bank located in the Purchaser\u2019s country or abroad, in the form provided in the bidding documents or another form acceptable to the Purchaser and valid for thirty (30) days beyond the validity of the bid; or \n\n(b)\na bank certified check.\n\n15.4\nAny bid not secured in accordance with ITB Clauses 15.1 and 15.3 will be rejected by the Purchaser as non-responsive, pursuant to ITB Clause 24.\n\n15.5\nUnsuccessful bidders\u2019 bid securities will be discharged or returned as promptly as possible but not later than thirty (30) days after the expiration of the period of bid validity prescribed by the Purchaser pursuant to ITB Clause 16.\n\n15.6\nThe successful Bidder\u2019s bid security will be discharged upon the Bidder signing the contract, pursuant to ITB Clause 34, and furnishing the performance security, pursuant to ITB Clause 35.\n\n15.7\nThe bid security may be forfeited:\n\n(a)\nif a Bidder:\n\n(i) \nwithdraws its bid during the period of bid validity specified by the Bidder on the Bid Form, or\n\n(ii)\ndoes not accept the correction of errors pursuant to ITB Clause 24.2; or\n\n(b)\nin the case of a successful Bidder, if the Bidder fails:\n\n(i)\nto sign the contract in accordance with ITB Clause 34; or\n\n(ii)\nto furnish performance security in accordance with ITB Clause 35.\n\n\n\n\t16.\nPeriod of Validity of Bids\n\t16.1\nBids shall remain valid for the period specified in the Bid Data Sheet after the date of bid submission prescribed by the Purchaser, pursuant to ITB Clause 19.  A bid valid for a shorter period shall be rejected by the Purchaser as non-responsive.\n\n16.2\nIn exceptional circumstances, the Purchaser may solicit the Bidder\u2019s consent to an extension of the period of validity.  The request and the responses thereto shall be made in writing (or by cable).  The bid security provided under ITB Clause 15 shall also be suitably extended.  A Bidder may refuse the request without forfeiting its bid security.  A Bidder granting the request will not be required nor permitted to modify its bid, except as provided in ITB Clause 16.3.\n\n16.3\nIn the case of fixed price contracts, if the award is delayed by a period exceeding sixty (60) days beyond the expiry of the initial bid validity, the contract price will be increased by a factor specified in the request for extension.\n\n\n\n\t17.\nFormat and Signing of Bid\n\t17.1\nThe Bidder shall prepare an original and the number of copies of the bid indicated in the Bid Data Sheet, clearly marking each \u201cORIGINAL BID\u201d and \u201cCOPY OF BID,\u201d as appropriate.  In the event of any discrepancy between them, the original shall govern.\n\n17.2\nThe original and the copy or copies of the bid shall be typed or written in indelible ink and shall be signed by the Bidder or a person or persons duly authorized to bind the Bidder to the contract.  All pages of the bid, except for un-amended printed literature, shall be initialed by the person or persons signing the bid.\n\n17.3\nAny interlineation, erasures, or overwriting shall be valid only if they are initialed by the person or persons signing the bid.\n\n17.4\nThe Bidder shall furnish information as described in the Form of Bid on commissions or gratuities, if any, paid or to be paid to agents relating to this Bid, and to contract execution if the Bidder is awarded the contract.\n\n\nD.

A withdrawal notice may also be sent by cable, but followed by a signed confirmation copy, postmarked not later than the deadline for submission of bids.\n\n21.3\nNo bid may be modified after the deadline for submission of bids.\n\n21.4\nNo bid may be withdrawn in the interval between the deadline \nfor submission of bids and the expiration of the period of bid \nvalidity specified by the Bidder on the Bid Form.  Withdrawal of \na bid during this interval may result in the Bidder\u2019s forfeiture of \nits bid security, pursuant to the ITB Clause 15.7.\n\n\nE.  Opening and Evaluation of Bids\n\n\t22.\nOpening of Bids by the Purchaser\n\t22.1\nThe Purchaser will open all bids in the presence of bidders\u2019 representatives who choose to attend, at the time, on the date, and at the place specified in the Bid Data Sheet.  The bidders\u2019 representatives who are present shall sign a register evidencing their attendance.\n\n22.2\nThe bidders\u2019 names, bid modifications or withdrawals, bid prices, discounts, and the presence or absence of requisite bid security and such other details as the Purchaser, at its discretion, may consider appropriate, will be announced at the opening.  No bid shall be rejected at bid opening, except for late bids, which shall be returned unopened to the Bidder pursuant to ITB Clause 20.\n\n22.3\nBids (and modifications sent pursuant to ITB Clause 21.2) that are not opened and read out at bid opening shall not be considered further for evaluation, irrespective of the circumstances.  \n\n22.4\nThe Purchaser will prepare minutes of the bid opening.\n\n\n\n\t23.\nClarification of Bids\n\t23.1\nDuring evaluation of the bids, the Purchaser may, at its discretion, ask the Bidder for a clarification of its bid.  The request for clarification and the response shall be in writing, and no change in the prices or substance of the bid shall be sought, offered, or permitted.\n\n\n\n\t24.\nPreliminary Examination\n\t24.1\nThe Purchaser will examine the bids to determine whether they are complete, whether any computational errors have been made, whether required sureties have been furnished, whether the documents have been properly signed, and whether the bids are generally in order.\n\n24.2\nArithmetical errors will be rectified on the following basis.  If there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total price that is obtained by multiplying the unit price and quantity, the unit price shall prevail, and the total price shall be corrected. If there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words will prevail.  If the Supplier does not accept the correction of the errors, its bid will be rejected, and its bid security may be forfeited.  \n\n24.3\nThe Purchaser may waive any minor informality, nonconformity, or irregularity in a bid which does not constitute a material deviation, provided such waiver does not prejudice or affect the relative ranking of any Bidder.\n\n24.4 Prior to the detailed evaluation, pursuant to ITB Clause 26, the Purchaser will determine the substantial responsiveness of each bid to the bidding documents.  For purposes of these Clauses, a substantially responsive bid is one which conforms to all the terms and conditions of the bidding documents without material deviations.  Deviations from, or objections or reservations to critical provisions, such as those concerning Bid Security (ITB Clause 15), Applicable Law (GCC Clause 31), and Taxes and Duties (GCC Clause 33), will be deemed to be a material deviation.  The Purchaser\u2019s determination of a bid\u2019s responsiveness is to be based on the contents of the bid itself without recourse to extrinsic evidence.\n\n24.5\nIf a bid is not substantially responsive, it will be rejected by the Purchaser and may not subsequently be made responsive by the Bidder by correction of the nonconformity.\n\n\n\n\t25.\nConversion to Single Currency\n\t25.1\nTo facilitate evaluation and comparison, the Purchaser will convert all bid prices expressed in the amounts in various currencies in which the bid prices are payable to either:\n\n(a)\nthe currency of the Purchaser\u2019s country at the selling exchange rate established for similar transactions by the Central Bank or a commercial bank in the Purchaser\u2019s country;\n\nor\n\n(b) a currency widely used in international trade, such as U.S.  Dollars, at the selling rate of exchange published in the international press for the amount payable in foreign currency; and at the selling exchange rate established for similar transactions by the Central Bank in the Purchaser\u2019s country for the amount payable in the currency of the Purchaser\u2019s country.\n\n25.2\nThe currency selected for converting bid prices to a common base for the purpose of evaluation, along with the source and date of the exchange rate, are specified in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n\n\n\t26.\nEvaluation and Comparison of Bids\n\t26.1\nThe Purchaser will evaluate and compare the bids which have been determined to be substantially responsive, pursuant to ITB Clause 24.\n\n26.2\nThe Purchaser\u2019s evaluation of a bid will not take into account:\n\n(a)\nin the case of goods manufactured in the Purchaser\u2019s country or goods of foreign origin already located in the Purchaser\u2019s country, sales and other similar taxes, which will be payable on the goods if a contract is awarded to the Bidder;\n\n(b)\nin the case of goods of foreign origin offered from abroad, customs duties and other similar import taxes which will be payable on the goods if the contract is awarded to the Bidder; and\n\n(c)\nany allowance for price adjustment during the period of execution of the contract, if provided in the bid.\n\n26.3\nThe comparison shall be between the EXW price of the goods offered from within the Purchaser\u2019s country, such price to include all costs, as well as duties and taxes paid or payable on components and raw material incorporated or to be incorporated in the goods, and the CIF named port of destination (or CIP border point, or CIP named place of destination) price of the goods offered from outside the Purchaser\u2019s country.\n\n26.4\nThe Purchaser\u2019s evaluation of a bid will take into account, in addition to the bid price quoted in accordance with ITB Clause 11.2, one or more of the following factors as specified in the Bid Data Sheet, and quantified in ITB Clause 26.5:\n\n(a)\nCost of inland transportation, insurance, and other costs within the Purchaser\u2019s country incidental to delivery of the goods to their final destination.\n\n(b)\ndelivery schedule offered in the bid;\n\n(c)\ndeviations in payment schedule from that specified in the Special Conditions of Contract;\n\n(d)\nthe cost of components, mandatory spare parts, and service;\n\n(e)\nthe availability in the Purchaser\u2019s country of spare parts and after-sales services for the equipment offered in the bid;\n\n(f)\nthe projected operating and maintenance costs during the life of the equipment;\n\n(g)\nthe performance and productivity of the equipment offered; and/or\n\n(h)\nOther specific criteria indicated in the Bid Data Sheet and/or in the Technical Specifications.\n\n26.5\nFor factors retained in the Bid Data Sheet pursuant to ITB 26.4, one or more of the following quantification methods will be applied, as detailed in the Bid Data Sheet:\n\n(a)\nInland transportation from EXW/port of entry/border point, insurance, and incidentals.\n\nInland transportation, insurance, and other incidental costs for delivery of the goods from EXW/port of entry/border point to Project Site named in the Bid Data Sheet will be computed for each bid by the Purchaser on the basis of published tariffs by the rail or road transport agencies, insurance companies, and/or other appropriate sources.  To facilitate such computation, bidder shall furnish in its bid the estimated dimensions and shipping weight and the approximate EXW/CIF (or CIP border point) value of each package.  The above cost will be added by the Purchaser to EXW/CIF/CIP border point price.\n\n(b)\nDelivery schedule.\n\n(i)\nThe Purchaser requires that the goods under the Invitation for Bids shall be delivered (shipped) at the time specified in the Schedule of Requirements.  The esti\u200bmated time of arrival of the goods at the Project Site will be calculated for each bid after allowing for reasonable international and inland transportation time.  Treating the bid resulting in the earliest time of arrival as the base, a delivery \u201cadjustment\u201d will be calculated for other bids by applying a percentage, specified in the Bid Data Sheet, of the EXW/CIF/CIP price for each week of delay beyond the base, and this will be added to the bid price for evaluation.  No credit shall be given to early delivery.\n\nor\n\n(ii)\nThe goods covered under this invitation are required to be delivered (shipped) within an acceptable range of weeks specified in the Schedule of Requirement.  No credit will be given to earlier deliveries, and bids offering delivery beyond this range will be treated as non-responsive.  Within this acceptable range, an adjustment per week, as specified in the Bid Data Sheet, will be added for evaluation to the bid price of bids offering deliveries later than the earliest delivery period specified in the Schedule of Requirements.\n\nor\n\n(iii)\nThe goods covered under this invitation are required to be delivered (shipped) in partial shipments, as specified in the Schedule of Requirements.  Bids offering deliveries earlier or later than the specified deliveries will be adjusted in the evaluation by adding to the bid price a factor equal to a percentage, specified in the Bid Data Sheet, of EXW/CIF/CIP price per week of variation from the specified delivery schedule.\n\n(c)\nDeviation in payment schedule.\n\n(i)\nBidders shall state their bid price for the payment schedule outlined in the SCC.  Bids will be evaluated on the basis of this base price.  Bidders are, however, permitted to state an alternative payment schedule and indicate the reduction in bid price they wish to offer for such alternative payment schedule.  The Purchaser may consider the alternative payment schedule offered by the selected Bidder.\n\nor\n\n(ii)\nThe SCC stipulates the payment schedule offered by the Purchaser.  If a bid deviates from the schedule and if such deviation is considered acceptable to the Purchaser, the bid will be evaluated by calculating interest earned for any earlier payments involved in the terms outlined in the bid as compared with those stipulated in this invitation, at the rate per annum specified in the Bid Data Sheet.\n\n(d)\nCost of spare parts.\n\n(i)\nThe list of items and quan\u200btities of major assemblies, components, and selected spare parts, likely to be required during the initial period of operation specified in the Bid Data Sheet, is annexed to the Technical Specifications.  The total cost of these items, at the unit prices quoted in each bid, will be added to the bid price.\n\nor\n\n(ii)\nThe Purchaser will draw up a list of high-usage and high-value items of components and spare parts, along with estimated quantities of usage in the initial period of operation specified in the Bid Data Sheet.  The total cost of these items and quan\u200btities will be computed from spare parts unit prices submitted by the Bidder and added to the bid price.\n\nor\n\n(iii)\nThe Purchaser will estimate the cost of spare parts usage in the initial period of operation specified in the Bid Data Sheet, based on information furnished by each Bidder, as well as on past experience of the Purchaser or other purchasers in similar situations.  Such costs shall be added to the bid price for evaluation.\n\n(e)\nSpare parts and after sales service facilities in the Purchaser\u2019s country.\n\nThe cost to the Purchaser of establishing the minimum service facilities and parts inventories, as outlined in the Bid Data Sheet or elsewhere in the bidding documents, if quoted separately, shall be added to the bid price.\n\n(f)\nOperating and maintenance costs.\n\nSince the operating and maintenance costs of the goods under procurement form a major part of the life cycle cost of the equipment, these costs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria specified in the Bid Data Sheet or in the Technical Specifications.\n\n(g)\nPerformance and productivity of the equipment.\n\n(i)\nBidders shall state the guaranteed performance or efficiency in response to the Technical Specification.  For each drop in the performance or efficiency below the norm of 100, an adjustment for an amount specified in the Bid Data Sheet will be added to the bid price, representing the capitalized cost of additional operating costs over the life of the plant, using the methodology specified in the Bid Data Sheet or in the Technical Specifications.\n\nor\n\n(ii)\nGoods offered shall have a minimum productivity specified under the relevant provision in the Technical Specifications to be considered responsive.

The lowest evaluated bid of each group will next be compared with the lowest evaluated bids of the other groups.  If this comparison results in a bid from Group A or Group B being the lowest, it will be selected for contract award.\n\n27.4\nIf, as a result of the preceding comparison, the lowest evaluated bid is from Group C, all Group C bids will then be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from Group A, after adding to the evaluated bid price of the imported goods offered in each Group C bid, for the purpose of this further comparison only:\n\n(a)\nthe amount of customs duties and other import taxes that a nonexempt importer would have to pay for the importation of goods offered in each Group C bid;\n\nor\n\n(b)\nfifteen (15) percent of the CIF (or CIP border point or CIP named place of destination, as the case may be) bid price of such goods, if the customs duties and taxes exceed fifteen (15) percent of the CIF (or CIP border point or CIP place of destination) price of such goods.\n\nIf the Group A bid in the further comparison is the lowest, it will be selected for award.

Award of Contract\n\n\t29.\nPost-qualification\n\t29.1\nIn the absence of prequalification, the Purchaser will determine to its satisfaction whether the Bidder that is selected as having submitted the lowest evaluated responsive bid is qualified to perform the contract satisfactorily, in accordance with the criteria listed in ITB Clause 13.3.\n\n29.2\nThe determination will take into account the Bidder\u2019s financial, technical, and production capabilities.  It will be based upon an examination of the documentary evidence of the Bidder\u2019s qualifications submitted by the Bidder, pursuant to ITB Clause 13.3, as well as such other information as the Purchaser deems necessary and appropriate.\n\n29.3\nAn affirmative determination will be a prerequisite for award of the contract to the Bidder.

The Purchaser will promptly respond in writing to the unsuccessful Bidder.\n\n\n\n\t34.\nSigning of Contract\n\t34.1\nAt the same time as the Purchaser notifies the successful Bidder that its bid has been accepted, the Purchaser will send the Bidder the Contract Form provided in the bidding documents, incorporating all agreements between the parties.\n\n34.2\nWithin thirty (30) days of receipt of the Contract Form, the successful Bidder shall sign and date the contract and return it to the Purchaser\n\n\t35.\nPerformance Security\n\t35.1 Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notification of award from the Purchaser, the successful Bidder shall furnish the performance security in accordance with the Conditions of Contract, in the Performance Security Form provided in the bidding documents, or in another form acceptable to the Purchaser.\n\n35.2\nFailure of the successful Bidder to comply with the requirement of ITB Clause 34.2 or ITB Clause 35.1 shall constitute sufficient grounds for the annulment of the award and forfeiture of the bid security, in which event the Purchaser may make the award to the next lowest evaluated Bidder or call for new bids.\n\n\n\n\t36.\nCorrupt or Fraudulent Practices\n\n\n\t36.1\nThe Purchaser requires that Bidders/Suppliers/Contractors, observe the highest standard of ethics during the procurement and execution of such contracts.
